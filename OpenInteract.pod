=head1 NAME

OpenInteract - A robust web application framework built to run under Apache and mod_perl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

OpenInteract is an extensible application server using Apache and
mod_perl built for developers but also to be manageable almost
entirely via the web browser. It includes:

=over 4

=item *

A robust system of components built on templates that can access your
data just about any way that you can think of.

=item *

A very flexible separation of presentation and data access: you can
use one template for accessing data from different sources using one
template (e.g., a listing of users from the system, from an LDAP
server, from an NT/SMB authentication controller, etc.) or you can use
one set of data to fill multiple templates.

=item *

A consistent security mechanism allowing you to control security for
users and groups not only at the task level, but also at the
individual data object level.

=item *

A simple user and group-management system that allows users to create
their own accounts and an administrator to assign them to one or more
groups.

=item *

A convenient packaging system that makes it simple for developers to
distribute code, configuration and all other information necessary for
an application. It also makes the installation and upgrading processes
very straightforward and simple.

=item *

An integrated, database-independent method for distributing data
necessary for a package. You should be able to install any package on
any database that's been tested with OpenInteract. (Some of this work
must be done by the package authors, but OpenInteract tries to make
this as painless as possible.)

=head2 Dependencies

OpenInteract uses a number of CPAN modules, relying heavily on the
following required modules:

B<SPOPS> (Simple Perl Object Persistence with Security). This module was
developed in tandem with this framework but stands on its own as a
full-featured object serialization system. It also implements security.

B<Template Toolkit>. This is the best templating environment available
for Perl. Version 2 has major performance improvements and also
includes usability enhancements. It's also required by OI.

B<Apache::Session>. Provide datasource-independent means of session
management.

Many others are also used -- why reinvent the wheel when there are so
many other well-built ones already around around and so many
interesting problems to conquer?

OpenInteract is usable B<right now>, out of the box. That doesn't mean
we're sitting on our laurels -- we're working on a number of different
features to OpenInteract which will be added soon to the 'TODO' file
found in the OpenInteract source directory.

=head1 INSTALLATION

A file 'INSTALL' is included with the OpenInteract distribution. It
shows you the simple steps needed for installation. If you ask this
question on a mailing list (below), someone will likely post:

=over 4

=item 1

Read and follow the directions in INSTALL.

=item 2

Read and follow the directions in INSTALL.

=item 3

Return to step (1).

=head1 DOCUMENTATION

OpenInteract comes with a few forms of documentation:

=over 4

=item *

B<System-wide>: These files are in HTML format and are geared for
people first learning about OpenInteract, whether from a
content-management view, developer view or administration view. You
can find them in the C<doc/> directory of the source distribution --
open up the C<index.html> file for a table of contents.

The files are also installed with every website. Once you have the
website up and running, go to:

http://mywebsite.com/SystemDoc/

And click on B<View OpenInteract Documentation>.

=item *

B<Package>: These files come in the C<doc/> subdirectory of every
package and give you some idea of what the package does and how you
can do it. Some packages (like C<base>) come with documentation that
describe integral system functionality.

To view the package documentation, go to:

http://mywebsite.com/SystemDoc/

And click on B<View Package Documentation>. This lists the packages
currently installed and the available documentation for each.

Note that package documentation is somewhat lacking right now, but
we're in the process of fixing this. In the meantime, check out the
B<Module> documentation below.

=item *

B<Module>: Normal Perl documentation can/should be found in the
modules that actually do the work. Since OpenInteract uses its own
packaging system you won't be able to find them via C<perldoc> as
usual. (You could circumvent this by putting the package directory in
the base installation in C<PERL5LIB>, but this isn't recommended.)

Instead, you can use the browser interface and go to:

http://mywebsite.com/SystemDoc/

And choose B<View SPOPS/OpenInteract Module Documentation>. This gives
you a web interface to view the modules (And yes, it looks fine
through lynx.)

Similarly, you can click on B<View Perl Module Documentation> and see
all the other Perl modules used by OpenInteract. Click on the module
name and you'll be able to see the docs online. This is especially
helpful for the B<Template Toolkit>, which comes with a huge amount of
documentation.

=head1 FEEDBACK

We're interested in your feedback on a number of topics. In particular:

=over 4

=item *

How did you find the installation process? Was OpenInteract simple to
install and configure?

=item *

How easy was it for you to create a website, install its SQL
structures and data and import its templates?

=item *

Which documentation do you feel is lacking? 

=back

As you might tell, we're keenly aware that installation and initial
understanding can be a big barrier to entry with a fairly substantial
application like this. Feedback is crucial for us to plug the holes.

We also hope to extend certain features (such as users and groups) to
different types of data sources, like LDAP directories. Other
applications of OpenInteract really depend on what you'd like it to
do!

Updates can be found in two places:

CVS access, mailing list information and archives, bug tracking.
