<H1><A NAME="name">NAME</A></H1>
<P>OpenInteract Actions - Tell OpenInteract how to respond to requests</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="description">DESCRIPTION</A></H1>
<P>This document will describe how Actions work in OpenInteract -- how
you can configure them, look them up and retrieve content using them.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="action table">ACTION TABLE</A></H1>
<P>The Action Table is the catalog that matches up action names to how
the action will be accomplished. Each package in OpenInteract must
specify the actions it implements in the file <CODE>conf/action.perl</CODE>.</P>
<P>The configuration file is a Perl hashref where the keys are
lower-cased names which correspond to the first URL chunk. The value
is a hashref with information about how that action should be
fulfilled. (Don't worry, it will all make sense shortly.)</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="the action/url connection">The Action/URL Connection</A></H2>
<P>First, note that while the action keys must always be lower-case, the
actual URLs that map to them can be of mixed case. This means that you
can't have differently-cased URLs of the same word perform different
actions -- for instance '/NEWS/' and '/news/' will refer to the same
action.</P>
<P>The keys in the configuration file correspond to top-level URL
commands. For instance, in the following URL:</P>
<PRE>
 /News/show/?news_id=484</PRE>
<P>The top-level command is 'News' and the task is 'show'. Once we parse
the URL we try to match the top-level command to an action from the
action table.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="fulfilling the action">Fulfilling the Action</A></H2>
<P>Once we match up the action to its implementation information, we need
to call it. First, what can be in its implementation information?</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<STRONG>class</STRONG> ($)
<P>The class used to return the content; used with 'method'.</P>
<P></P>
<LI>
<STRONG>method</STRONG> ($) (optional)
<P>The method run from 'class' to return the content. If not given, use
the method 'handler'.</P>
<P></P>
<LI>
<STRONG>security</STRONG> (yes|no) (optional)
<P>Only utilized when the action is a component. Checks whether security
should be checked when running the action -- 'yes' means security
should be checked, 'no' means it shouldn't. If not given, use 'yes'.</P>
<P></P>
<LI>
<STRONG>conductor</STRONG> ($) (optional)
<P>The conductor to use. Currently there is only one conductor ('main'),
but in the future you might have different conductors -- one for SOAP,
one for WAP, etc. If not given, use the default conductor, given in
the '_default_action_info_' action in your 'server.perl' configuration
file.</P>
<P></P>
<LI>
<STRONG>redir</STRONG> ($) (optional)
<P>Actions can redirect to an action which actually fulfills it. For
instance, say we wanted the <STRONG>news</STRONG> package to respond not only to
'news' but also to 'nouvelles' for your French-speaking
audience. Instead of repeating the same information in separate places
(and risk changing only one in the future), you would do something
like:</P>
<PRE>
 'nouvelles' =&gt; { redir =&gt; 'news' },</PRE>
<P>Redirects can nest as many levels deep as you need.</P>
<P></P>
<LI>
<STRONG>template</STRONG> ($) (optional)
<P>For template-only components, the name of the template to run. (Also
see 'package' below.)</P>
<P></P>
<LI>
<STRONG>package</STRONG> ($) (optional)
<P>For template-only components, the package the template (specified in
'template') is in.</P>
<P></P>
<LI>
<STRONG>title</STRONG> ($) (optional)
<P>Use in boxes only -- the title of the box.</P>
<P></P>
<LI>
<STRONG>weight</STRONG> ($) (optional)
<P>Use in boxes only -- the weight of the box.</P>
<P></P></UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="toplevel directives">Top-level Directives</A></H2>
<P>The only exception to the above parsing scheme is when the first item
in the URL is a directive. Directives tell OpenInteract something
about the request as a whole, generally how it will be displayed.</P>
<P>For instance, when you move your mouse over the 'Logout' in the
default user_info_box (found in the <STRONG>base_component</STRONG> package) you'll
see something like:</P>
<PRE>
  <A HREF="http://www.mysite.com/NoTmpl/Logout/?return=/docs/oi_is_great.html">http://www.mysite.com/NoTmpl/Logout/?return=/docs/oi_is_great.html</A></PRE>
<P>The 'NoTmpl' in this URL is a directive that tells OpenInteract not to
use a main template at all when displaying content.</P>
<P>The directives are all listed in your 'server.perl' file under the
'page_directives' key. The only other directive currently implemented
is 'Popup', which tells OpenInteract to use the 'simple' template (by
default this is 'base_simple'). This template typically has very
little in the way of graphics and layout.</P>
<P>So when OpenInteract encounters one of these directives, it removes it
from the URL and saves it for later so the Conductor knows which main
template to put the content into.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="sample configuration">SAMPLE CONFIGURATION</A></H1>
<P>First, let's take an easy one -- the action.perl file from the <STRONG>base</STRONG>
package:</P>
<PRE>
 $action = {
            'logout'    =&gt; {
                'class'     =&gt; 'OpenInteract::Handler::Logout',
                'security'  =&gt; 'no',
            },
            'redirect' =&gt; { 
                'class'     =&gt; 'OpenInteract::Handler::Redirect',
                'security'  =&gt; 'no',
            },
            'package' =&gt; {
                'class'     =&gt; 'OpenInteract::Handler::Package',
                'security'  =&gt; 'yes',
            },
 };</PRE>
<P>This defines four actions: 'logout', 'redirect', 'boxes',
'package'. You can visualize the action table as:</P>
<PRE>
 URL         Action
 ======================================================
 /logout     OpenInteract::Handler::Logout-&gt;handler()
 /redirect   OpenInteract::Handler::Redirect-&gt;handler()
 /boxes      OpenInteract::Handler::Boxes-&gt;handler()
 /package    OpenInteract::Handler::Package-&gt;handler()</PRE>
<P>Next, something a little more interesting. This is taken from the
<STRONG>news</STRONG> package, distributed with OpenInteract:</P>
<PRE>
 $action = {
           'news'      =&gt; {
                'class'     =&gt; 'OpenInteract::Handler::News',
                'security'  =&gt; 'yes',
            },
            'latest_news' =&gt; {
                'class'     =&gt; 'OpenInteract::Handler::News',
                'method'    =&gt; 'latest',
                'security'  =&gt; 'no',
            },
            'news_tools_box' =&gt; {
                'template' =&gt; 'news_tools_box',
                'package'  =&gt; 'news',
                'title'    =&gt; 'News Tools',
                'weight'   =&gt; 4,
                'security' =&gt; 'no',
            },
            'latestnews'   =&gt; { redir =&gt; 'latest_news' },
            'newstoolsbox' =&gt; { redir =&gt; 'news_tools_box' },
 };</PRE>
<P>This defines a normal action ('news') an action that is designed to be
addressed as a component ('latestnews'), a template-only action
('news_tools_box') and two different spellings which use the redirect
action. This action table will look like:</P>
<PRE>
 URL           Action
 ====================================================
 /news         OpenInteract::Handler::News-&gt;handler()
 /latest_news  OpenInteract::Handler::News-&gt;latest()
 /latestnews   OpenInteract::Handler::News-&gt;latest()</PRE>
<P>Additionally, you can call the toolbox two ways:</P>
<PRE>
 [% OI.box_add( 'news_tools_box' ) %]
 [% OI.comp( 'news_tools_box' ) %]</PRE>
<P>The first is recommended because you can override the default box
information with your own:</P>
<PRE>
 [% OI.box_add( 'news_tools_box', weight = 1, 
                                  title = 'Okeley-Dokeley-News Box' ) %]</PRE>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="walking through a request">WALKING THROUGH A REQUEST</A></H1>
<P>Now we will walk through a request from the action table's
perspective. This example will assume the configuration given above
for the <STRONG>news</STRONG> package has been read in properly.</P>
<P><STRONG>URL given</STRONG>: /News/show/?news_id=484</P>
<OL>
<LI>
<STRONG>Parse the URL</STRONG>
<P>This gives us an array with:</P>
<PRE>
 ( 'News', 'show' )</PRE>
<P>The GET parameters are retrieved later.</P>
<P></P>
<LI>
<STRONG>Map the first part of the URL to an action</STRONG>
<P>The action 'news' does exist (note the case-change -- a URL action is
lowercased before trying to map it in the action table) and uses the
handler <CODE>OpenInteract::Handler::News</CODE>.</P>
<P></P>
<LI>
<STRONG>Call the appropriate action</STRONG>
<P>With the above, we call:</P>
<PRE>
 OpenInteract::Handler::News-&gt;handler();</PRE>
<P>(with the note that 'handler' is defined as the default method in the
'action_info.default' key of our main website configuration in
<CODE>conf/server.ini</CODE>)</P>
<P>This returns the content for the page which is then plugged into the
main template.</P>
<P></P></OL>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="faq">FAQ</A></H1>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="which happens if i can't match an action to the url">Which happens if I can't match an action to the URL?</A></H2>
<P>There are two distinct cases for this:</P>
<OL>
<LI>
<STRONG>There is no path</STRONG>
<P>This happens when someone goes to your home page:</P>
<PRE>
 <A HREF="http://www.openinteract.org/">http://www.openinteract.org/</A></PRE>
<P>The file 'home.html' (or 'index.html', or 'default.htm', depending on
how your webserver handles directory requests) is typically
``understood'' here by web servers. But since it's not specified
OpenInteract has no way to know.</P>
<P>To deal with this, define an action whose key is an empty string. This
is defined for you in your <CODE>conf/server.ini</CODE> file in your main
website configuration directory. The key 'action_info.none' holds
action specifications to take in this case.</P>
<P></P>
<LI>
<STRONG>The path cannot be found</STRONG>
<P>What happens if someone tries to find the document:</P>
<PRE>
 <A HREF="http://www.mysite.com/zaphrod/live/now.html">http://www.mysite.com/zaphrod/live/now.html</A></PRE>
<P>And you don't have an action mapped to 'zaphrod'? OpenInteract will
use the action defined in the configuration key
'action_info.not_found'. Typically this maps to the 'base_page'
package which treats the path as a normal file request and serves up a
file from either the filesystem or the directory.</P>
<P>As an example, for the above request the base page handler would try
to find either a file or object which has the location
'/zaphrod/live/now.html'. It would also try '/zaphrod/live/now'
(without the file extension).</P>
<P></P></OL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="why doesn't my website's information match the examples">Why doesn't my website's information match the examples?</A></H2>
<P>Instead of seeing <CODE>OpenInteract::Handler::News</CODE> in your website's
configuration files , you'll see something similar except with the
name of your website instead of 'OpenInteract'. Each website needs a
separate namespace so that each website can customize its handlers and
keep its data reasonably separate.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="do i have to define all the information for every action">Do I have to define all the information for every action?</A></H2>
<P>No! The <CODE>server.perl</CODE> configuration file also defines the
'_default_action_info_' key under the 'action' key. Specify
information that you would like to appear by default in the action
configuration and at server startup it will be copied to the
configuration only if a value previously was not defined.</P>
<P>For instance, in the configuration files above we never (well, except
once) specified the method to call. That's because we defined it in
'_default_action_info' to be 'handler'. We also specify the conductor
to use by default and the template implementation class to use.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="how can i ensure the configuration file's syntax is ok">How can I ensure the configuration file's syntax is ok?</A></H2>
<P>Two ways:</P>
<OL>
<LI>
Run a normal Perl syntax check:
<PRE>
 [cwinters@genesee news]$ perl -c conf/action.perl
 conf/action.perl syntax OK</PRE>
<P>This is the easiest to do, and you can probably script your editor to
do this whenever you hit the <CODE>F9</CODE> key or something.</P>
<P></P>
<LI>
Run the 'check_package' command of <CODE>oi_manage</CODE>:
<PRE>
 [cwinters@genesee news]$ oi_manage check_package
 Running check_package...
 =========================</PRE>
<PRE>
