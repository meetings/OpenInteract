    <h1>Databases and OpenInteract</h1>


    <p>OpenInteract is designed to work with one or more relational
    database systems (RDBMS). Thanks to SPOPS, it can be flexible
    about which one it uses. But you still need to do some initial
    setup work to ensure your database is prepared.</p>

    <p>This document describes the different procedures necessary to
    use OpenInteract with the databases it supports. It does not cover
    setting up the various RDBMS packages themselves and assumes you
    have a database server up and running.</p>

    <p>In the discussion below we use a few variables. These will, of
    course, depend on your DBMS.</p>

    <ul>

      <li><code>$ADMINUSER</code>: A user with sufficient
      administrative rights to create a database</li>

      <li><code>$ADMINPASSWORD</code>: The password for
      <code>$ADMINUSER</code></li>

      <li><code>$DBNAME</code>: The name you give your database.</li>

      <li><code>$WEBUSER</code>: The user that is going to access this
      database via OpenInteract. This user must be able to create and
      drop tables as well as modify data within those tables.</li>

      <li><code>$WEBPASSWORD</code>: The password for
      <code>$WEBUSER</code></li>

    </ul>

    <p>The following also assumes that the command-line utilities
    executed (e.g., 'mysql', 'psql', 'isql') are installed and on your
    PATH. If not, setup your PATH so they're accessible for executing
    or ask your friendly local DBA to do this for you.</p>

    <h1>MySQL</h1>

    <p>To create a database, run the following command:</p>

    <code>
  $ mysqladmin --user=$ADMINUSER --password=$ADMINPASSWORD create $DBNAME
    </code>

    <p>Once the database is created, ensure that the
    non-administrative user you've chosen to use with OpenInteract has
    full access to it. The following will create a new user with
    access to your database:</p>

    <pre>
 $ mysql --user=$ADMINUSER --password=$ADMINPASSWORD $DBNAME
 mysql> GRANT ALL ON $DBNAME.* TO $WEBUSER@localhost 
 mysql> IDENTIFIED BY '$WEBPASSWORD'\g
    </pre>

    <p>You probably also need to give this user permission to use the
    'mysql' database:</p>

    <pre>
 mysql> GRANT SELECT ON mysql.* TO $WEBUSER@localhost 
 mysql> IDENTIFIED BY '$WEBPASSWORD'\g
    </pre>

    <p>Once you're done with these statements, leave the mysql shell
    and reload the grant tables:</p>

    <pre>
 $ mysqladmin --user=$ADMINUSER --password=$ADMINPASSWORD reload
    </pre>

    <h1>PostgreSQL</h1>

    <p>To create a database, run the following command:</p>

    <pre>
  $ createdb $DBNAME
    </pre>

    <p>Once you've created the database, you can create a user:</p>

    <pre>
  $ psql $DBNAME
  psql> create user $WEBUSER 
  psql> with password '$WEBPASSWORD' nocreatedb nocreateuser\g
    </pre>
