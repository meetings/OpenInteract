<h1>OpenInteract Developer's Guide</h1>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>First, have you read the Illustrated Manager's Guide to
OpenInteract and the OpenInteract Administrator's Guide?

<P>We will take the following approach to explaining how things work
in OpenInteract: first, we give you some overview information (you
have read the stuff referred to in last paragraph, have you?), then we
will explain things in a little more detail, and finally, along the
way, we will show you how to build a simple package that displays data
from a database (following tradition, this will be the famous fruit
example database (table fruit, fields id, name, taste, price), so
things don't get too complicated.</p>


<h1>Packages</h1>

<P>
A package is all the code, SQL structures, initial data, configuration
information and anything else necessary to implement functionality in
OpenInteract.

<P>
In OpenInteract, packages implement the actual application
functionality.  OpenInteract handles the storage interface (e.g.,
putting your objects in a database), dispatches URL requests to your
objects (this is called <EM>handling</EM> an <EM>action</EM>),
security, authentication and authorization, and session management.

<P>
Applications need to define objects, which is how an application handles
its state. It also needs to define how the objects are to be manipulated,
which users can access them and how functionality is exposed to the user
(by way of a URL-to-action mapping).

<P>
What goes into a package? In general, you will find:

<UL>

<LI><b>Perl module code</b>: This can include handler code, SPOPS object code
and installation code.

<LI><b>Configuration</b>: Generally this includes two files in the
<code>conf/</code> directory: <code>action.perl</code> and
<code>spops.perl</code>, both of which are discussed further below.

<LI><b>Templates and Components</b>: Graphical interface to package
functionality.  Normally these are HTML files interspersed with
template processing commands which makes the data the package manages
visible to the user.

<LI><b>Installation information</b>: This includes the
<code>package.conf</code> file along with the SQL installation class.

<LI><b>Package data structures and data</b>: These are used by the SQL
installation class to install tables and any initial data needed by
the package. These data can also be installed to other tables in
OpenInteract.

<LI><b>Documentation</b>: The 'create_skeleton' command of
<code>oi_manage</code> will create a preliminary POD file for you
which documents your package.  You are strongly encouraged to fill in
the blanks and add meaningful detail along with any other necessary
files to let people know what functionality your package provides.

</ul>

<p>(If you are experiencing problems with the terms, take a look at
the <a href="glossary.html">glossary</a> we provided. Even if you
don't have problems with the terms we use, it might be a good idea to
do so now.)

<h1>Example: The Start</h1>

<P>Obviously, OpenInteract comes with tools to install, uninstall and
query currently installed packages. This greatly simplifies the task
of creating, testing and distributing your application.

<P>We will now set up a skeleton package (we don't want to do all this
from scratch):

<pre><font size="-1">
$ oi_manage --base_dir /tmp/OpenInteract/ --package fruit create_skeleton
Creating package skeleton in current directory.
=========================

Package fruit          : ok

=========================
Finished with create_skeleton!
</font></pre>

<p>Let's see what it did for us:

<pre><font size="-1">
$ find fruit/
fruit/
fruit/conf
fruit/conf/spops.perl
fruit/conf/action.perl

<p>
Now, what does all this stuff mean to you?

</FONT></PRE>

<P>
You will normally need to edit/add the following:

<P>
<PRE><FONT SIZE="-1">
mypkg/package.conf         # Add name, version, author information
mypkg/MANIFEST             # Add names of distribution files
mypkg/Changes              # Let people know about what you've improved/fixed
mypkg/conf/spops.perl      # Describe the objects your package uses
mypkg/conf/action.perl     # Map URLs to handlers in your package
mypkg/data                 # Specify the initial data and security
mypkg/struct               # Describe the tables used to store your objects
mypkg/template             # HTML to display and manipulate your objects
mypkg/OpenInteract         # Optional Perl modules defining object behavior
mypkg/OpenInteract/Handler # Manipulate objects for desired functionality
mypkg/doc/mypkg.pod        # Last but not least, tell the world about it
</FONT></PRE>

<P>
By the way, the MANIFEST file can be created automatically. (Perl is
great.) Here's how:

<P>
<PRE><FONT SIZE="-1"> 
$ cd /path/to/mypackage
$ perl -MExtUtils::Manifest -e 'ExtUtils::Manifest::mkmanifest()'
</FONT></PRE>

<P>That's it! If you have an old 'MANIFEST' file in the directory it
will be copied to 'MANIFEST.bak'. Also note that files matching
patterns in the 'MANIFEST.SKIP' file will not be included.

<p>Now we'll step through what makes up a package and along the way
edit the necessary files to make our own package.

<H1>Package composition</H1>

<P>
Now that you've created a package already, you've seen most of its
contents. (The ones you care about, anyway.) However, each package is
a <code>OpenInteract::Package</code> object -- a normal SPOPS
object. (An <a href="spops_overview.html">SPOPS overview</a> is
included with this documentation, and you can find out much more from
<code>perldoc SPOPS::Manual</code>.)

<P>OpenInteract maintains a registry of installed packages in a central
location. (To find the file, go to the <code>conf/</code> directory of
your base OpenInteract installation. The
<code>package_repository.perl</code> holds the information.)

<P>This registry includes meta information about all currently
installed packages -- author, install date, version, etc. You can
browse the information using a command-line tool (named
<code>oi_manage</code>) to see what is currently installed, along with
querying the information to find dependencies, authors, etc.


<h2>package.conf: General package information</h2>

<p>
Now, we need to edit our package information. We does this to identify
our package to OpenInteract.

<pre><font size="-1">
$ cd fruit/
$ cat package.conf
name           fruit
version        0.01
author         Who AmI <me@whoami.com>
url            http://www.whereami.com/
sql_installer  OpenInteract::SQLInstall::Fruit
description
Description of your package goes here.
</font></pre>

<p>After some editing...</p>

<pre><font size="-1">
$ cat package.conf
name           fruit
version        0.01
author         wizards@openinteract.org
url            http://www.openinteract.org/
sql_installer  OpenInteract::SQLInstall::Fruit
description 
Demo package for showing how to build an OpenInteract package.
Traditional style, fruit flavor.
</font></pre>

<p>The only non-obvious thing here is the <code>sql_installer</code>
stuff - it is the name of a class that contains code that tells the
<code>oi_manage</code> tool how to setup the database structure and
the initial data for your package. When you run the command
<code>create_skeleton</code>, <code>oi_manage</code> creates a simple
one for you to which you'll have to add names of SQL files and
installer data files as needed.</p>


<h2>conf/spops.perl: Describe package objects</h2>

<p>Now we need to define the objects that we want to use to show our
fruit data to the world.  We do this by editing the
<code>spops.perl</code> file. This file is in fact just input for a
template processing mechanism somewhere deep in the OpenInteract
framework that will generate Perl code for your object.

<pre><font size="-1">
$ cat conf/spops.perl
# This is a sample spops.perl file. Its purpose is to define the
# objects that will be used in your package. Each of the keys is
# commented below.

# If you do not plan on defining any objects for your package, then
# you can skip this discussion and leave the file as-is.

# Note that you must edit this file by hand -- there is no web-based
# interface for editing a package's spops.perl (or other)
# configuration files.

# You can have any number of entries in this file, although they
# should all be members of the single hashref (any name is ok) in the
# file.

# The syntax for this file is checked when you do a 'check_package'
# with the 'oi_manage' tool -- this is a good idea to do.

# Finally, you can retrieve this information (some in a slightly
# different format) at anytime by doing:
#
#   my $hashref = $object_class->CONFIG;
# or
#   my $hashref = $R->object-alias->CONFIG;

# For more information about the SPOPS configuration process, see
# 'perldoc SPOPS::Configure' and 'perldoc SPOPS::Configure::DBI'

$spops = {

# 'object-alias' - Defines how you can refer to the object class
# within OpenInteract. For portability and a host of other reasons, OI
# sets up aliases for the SPOPS object classes so you can refer to
# them from $R. For instance, if you are in an application 'MyApp':
#
#  my $user_class = $R->user;
#  print ">> User Class: <<$user_class>
#
#  Output: '>> User Class: <<MyApp::User>>'
#
# This way, your application can do:
#
#  my $object = $R->myobjectalias->fetch( $object_id );
#
# and not care about the different application namespaces and such.
#
# Note that the 'alias' key allows you to setup additional aliases for
# this object class.

#            'user' => {

# class - Defines the class this object will be known by. When you
# develop you'll refer to it here as 'OpenInteract::Blah' -- when the
# package is applied to a website, the class will be modified by
# OpenInteract to be in that website's namespace.

#              class        => 'OpenInteract::User',

# code_class - Perl module from which we read subroutines into the
# namespace of this class. This is *entirely optional*, only needed if
# you have additional behaviors to program into our object.

#              code_class   => 'OpenInteract::User',

# isa - Define the parents of this class. Every class should have at
# least 'OpenInteract::SPOPS::DBI' or 'OpenInteract::SPOPS::LDAP' and
# some sort of SPOPS implementation, usually 'SPOPS::DBI'

#              isa          => [ qw/ OpenInteract::SPOPS::DBI  SPOPS::Secure
#                                    SPOPS::DBI::MySQL  SPOPS::DBI / ],

# field - List of fields/properties of this object

#              field        => [ qw/ user_id first_name last_name email
#                                    login_name password theme_id / ],

# id_field - Name of primary key field -- this only identifies the
# object uniquely. You still need to deal with generating new values,
# either by an auto-incrementing mechanism (in which case you need to
# use the appropriate SPOPS::DBI class) or something else.

#              id_field     => 'user_id',

# increment_field - Whether to use (or be aware of) auto-incrementing
# features of your database driver.

#              increment_field => 1,

# no_insert - Fields for which we should not try to insert
# information, ever. If you're using a SPOPS implementation (e.g.,
# 'SPOPS::DBI::MySQL') which generates primary key values for you, be
# sure to put your 'id_field' value here.

#              no_insert    => [ qw/ user_id / ],

# no_update - Fields we should never update

#              no_update    => [ qw/ user_id / ],

# skip_undef - Values for these fields will not be inserted/updated at
# all if the value within the object is undefined. This, along with
# 'sql_defaults', allows you to specify default values.

#              skip_undef   => [ qw/ theme_id / ],

# sql_defaults - List fields for which a default is defined. Note that
# SPOPS::DBI will re-fetch the object after first creating it if you
# have fields listed here to ensure that the object always reflects
# what's in the database.

#              sql_defaults => [ qw/ theme_id / ],

# base_table - Name of the table we store the object tinformation
# in. Note that if you have 'db_owner' defined in your application's
# 'server.perl' file (in the 'db_info' key), then SPOPS will prepend
# that (along with a period) to the table name here. For instance, if
# the db_owner is defined to 'dbo', we would use the table name
# 'dbo.sys_user'

#              base_table   => 'sys_user',

# alias - Additional aliases to use for referring to this object
# class. For instance, if we put 'project_user' here we'd be able to
# retrieve this class name by using '$R->user' AND '$R->project_user'.

#              alias        => [],

# has_a - Define a 'has-a' relationship between objects from this
# class and any number of other objects. Each key in the hashref is an
# object class (which gets translated to your app's class when you
# apply the package to an application) and the value is an arrayref of
# field names. The field name determines the name of the routine
# created: if the field name matches up with the 'id_field' of that
# class, then we create a subroutine named for the object's
# 'object-alias' field. If the field name does not match, we append
# '_{object_alias}' to the end of the field. (See 'perldoc
# SPOPS::Configre' for more.)

#              has_a        => { 'OpenInteract::Theme' => [ 'theme_id' ], },

# links_to - Define a 'links-to' relationship between objects from
# this class and any number of other objects. This may be modified
# soon -- see 'perldoc SPOPS::Configure::DBI' for more.

#              links_to     => { 'OpenInteract::Group' => 'sys_group_user' },

# creation_security - Determine the security to apply to newly created
# objects from this class. (See 'SPOPS::Secure')

#              creation_security => {
#                 u   => 'WRITE',
#                 g   => { 3 => 'WRITE' },
#                 w   => 'READ',
#              },

# track - Which actions should we log? True value logs action, false
# value does not.

#              track => {
#                 create => 0, update => 1, remove => 1
#              },

# display - Allow the object to be able to generate a URL to display itself.

#              display => { url => '/User/show/', class => 'OpenInteract::Handler::User', method =>
 'show' },

# name - Either a field name or a coderef (first and only arg =
# object) to generate a name for a particular object.

#              name => sub { return $_[0]->full_name },

# object_name - Name of this class of objects

#              object_name => 'User',
#            },

};
</font></pre>

<p>Wow, that was quite a mouthful. Do we really need all this stuff?
Yes. But it's actually easy to modify. And it has a lot of comments,
as you might have noticed. Just follow the online instructions. BTW,
you are expected to edit this stuff, and to uncomment all the lines
that do apply to you.</p>

<p>After some editing, showing only the defined fields...</p>

<h2>struct/ and data/: Describe SQL structures and data</h2>

<p>Having defined our Fruit object, we will specify the table
structure in the database that is used to store our Fruit
objects. Additionally, we will specify some initial data to go into
those tables.

<p>All SQL data structures go into the <code>struct/</code> directory,
and you should have only one table per file.</p>

<p>[ ... editing ... ]</p>

<pre><font size="-1">
$ cat struct/fruit.sql
create table fruit (
    id &#037;&#037;INCREMENT&#037;&#037;,
    name varchar(255),
    taste varchar(255),
    price varchar(255),
    primary key (id)
)
</font></pre>

<p>That funny <code>&#037;&#037;INCREMENT&#037;&#037;</code> thing in
there is an OpenInteract feature: it tells OpenInteract to
automatically generate an id for every object we insert into the
table, making an "autoincrement id" command for most
databases. However, databases like Oracle, PostgreSQL and InterBase,
doesn't support autoincrementing fields, and we need to manage this
with a <code>sequence</code>. (In InterBase parlance this is a
<code>generator</code>.)</p>

<p>Due to this we need to create a file for the sequence (for
PostgreSQL and Oracle) and for the generator. Note that we need to
make the sequence/generator name the same as we set in our
<code>conf/spops.perl</code> file under the <code>sequence_name</code>
key. (Normally we'd also create a special Oracle-friendly version of
the table, but since this is a demo and the <code>varchar</code>
(vs. <code>varchar2</code>) fields will serve our purpose we'll skip
this step.)</p>

<p>[ ... editing ... ]</p>

<pre><font size="-1">
$ cat struct/fruit_sequence.sql
CREATE SEQUENCE oi_fruit_seq

$ cat struct/fruit_generator.sql
CREATE GENERATOR oi_fruit_seq
</font></pre>


<p>Now, some data. All data goes into the (you guessed it!)
<code>data/</code> directory in your package.</p>

<p>[ ... editing ... ]</p>

<pre><font size="-1">
$ cat data/fruit-initial-data.perl
$data = [
    { 
        spops_class => 'OpenInteract::Fruit',
        field_order => [ qw( name taste price ) ],
    }, 
    [ "Apple", "slightly sour", "1.00" ],
    [ "Banana", "sweet", "1.00" ],
    [ "Cherry", "red", "0.05" ],
    [ "Tomato", "yes, this is a fruit - look it up in the dictionary", "1.00" ],
];

</font></pre>

<p>Yes, this is actually a Perl data structure, and not SQL. It's more
database-independent that way.</p>

<p>We have now to create a special class that will do the setup for
our data in the database. We just edit the template provided for us.
Note how we handle the special cases for Oracle, PostgreSQL and
InterBase users, and how this could be extended to manage any other
nonstandard database users.</p>

</font></pre>

<p>Since we're just in development, we won't actually install these
structures and data just yet. We'll do that below once we're done
editing templates and other information.</p>

<h2>template/: display your objects</h2>

<p>Now we have a nice little table in our database (at least in
theory), and objects that will be able to fetch and store themselves
there. But we still need to show this to the world. That's where
templates come in.</p>

<P>Basically, a template is just a file of text that contains special
directives that will be processed by a template processor (the
Template Toolkit in this case). Our package will define a handler that
gets the objects from the database, and hand their attribute values
over to the template processor. The template processor in turn will
replace the template directives in the file with the corresponding
object attribute values. You will usually have more than one template.</p>


<p>Some template basics (you should take the time to read the <a
href="templates.html">OpenInteract template documentation</a> - for
more advanced uses of templates, you might want to have a look at the
documentation for the Template Toolkit.</p>

<P>

   &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;[% OI.login.full_name %]&lt;/font&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
</FONT></PRE>

<P>
When run through the template processing engine with a normal user
object in the 'login' key of the 'OI' plugin, this will result in:</p>

<PRE><FONT SIZE="-1"> &lt;p&gt;Welcome back 
   &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Charlie Brown&lt;/font&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

on the user who was viewing the page. If another user viewed the page,
she might have seen:

   &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Peppermint Patty&lt;/font&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
</FONT></PRE>

<P>OpenInteract provides a number of information and behaviors for you
in every template you write. However, you can also provide your
templates access to query results from the various data stores that
SPOPS provides.</p>


<P>Now, let's start building our own:

<p>[ ... editing again ... ]</p>

<pre><font size="-1">
$ cat template/fruit-display.tmpl
&lt;h1&gt;Fruits in store&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what is in store right now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align="center"&gt;

[% INCLUDE table_bordered_begin( table_width = '50%' ) -%]

[% INCLUDE header_row( labels = [ 'Item', 'Description', 'Price (in local units)' ] ) -%]

[% FOREACH fruit = fruits_in_store -%]
&lt;tr valign="top" bgcolor="[% PROCESS row_color( count = loop.count ) %]"&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;[% fruit.name %]&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;[% fruit.taste %]&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;[% fruit.price %]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
[% END -%]

[% INCLUDE table_bordered_end -%]

</div>

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for looking at our modest fruit assortment!
&lt;p&gt;The Management

<p>Eek, that looks a little scary at first! All those square-bracket
tags are special directives for the <a
href="http://www.template-toolkit.org/">Template Toolkit</a>, a very
powerful system which provides its own "mini language" to allow
processing commands to be inserted into the HTML which describe common
elements, and any data passed to the template processor. Don't worry
too much for now about all these tags, but notice the way it loops
over the <code>fruits_in_store</code> data from our fruit table, and
writes out the name, taste and price of each row.</p>


<h2>OpenInteract/Handler/: Manipulate objects for desired functionality</h2>

<p>Now, the fun part! We will write a handler that fetches our objects
from the database, puts the data into our template, and returns the
resulting HTML for handing it off to the browser.</p>

<p>[ ... editing again ... ]</p>

<pre><font size="-1">
$ cat OpenInteract/Handler/Fruit.pm
package OpenInteract::Handler::Fruit;

use strict;

$OpenInteract::Handler::Fruit::VERSION = '0.02';
$OpenInteract::Handler::Fruit::author = 'chris@cwinters.com';

sub handler {
  my ( $class, $p ) = @_;
  my $R = OpenInteract::Request->instance;
  my ( $error_msg );
  my $fruits = eval { $R->fruit->fetch_group({ 'order' => 'name' }) };
  if ( $@ ) {
      $error_msg = "Found error when trying to fetch fruit: " .
                   SPOPS::Error->get->{system_msg};
  }
  my $params = { fruits_in_store => $fruits, error_msg => $error_msg };
  $R->{page}{title} = 'All Fruit in Store';
  return $R->template->handler( {}, $params,
                                { name => 'fruit::fruit-display' } );
}

</font></pre>

<h2>conf/action.perl:  Map URLs to handlers in your package</h2>

<p>Well, after having written this handler - how will it get called by
the user?</p>

<p>This is what the <code>conf/action.perl</code> file is
for. Remember, it maps URLs to handlers. (See <a
href="actions.html">this guide to actions</a> for more
information.</p> So, we simply put in a URL (we just make one up -
that's the nice thing with dynamic web pages), and map it to our
handler routine. Then, we the user types in the URL, or clicks on a
link that contains the URL, our handler will magically get called,
returns its HTML, and the user can have a look at our Fruit objects.</p>

<p>[ ... editing again ... ]</p>

<pre><font size="-1">

$ cat conf/action.perl
(only non-commented lines shown)
$action = {
   'fruit' => {
     class   => 'OpenInteract::Handler::Fruit',
     method  => 'handler',
   },
};
</font></pre>


<h2>doc/mypackage.pod - Last but not least, tell the world about it</h2>

<p>Documentation of the Fruit package is left as an exercise for the
reader. Go read <code>perldoc perlpod</code>. A starter documentation
file is available in <code>doc/package.pod</code> when you run
<code>oi_manage</code> to create a package skeleton. (Aren't we nice?)</p>

<h2>MANIFEST - Add names of distribution files</h2>

<p>Now we need to install our package. And for that, we need to
package it up. So, which files do we need in there? Well, a first
approximation would be just all the files in the current directory and
its subdirectories.  This can be done automatically. (Perl is great.)
Here's how:

<PRE><FONT SIZE="-1"> 
$ cd fruit
$ perl -MExtUtils::Manifest -e 'ExtUtils::Manifest::mkmanifest()'
</FONT></PRE>

<P>
That's it! If you have an old 'MANIFEST' file in the directory it will be
copied to 'MANIFEST.bak'. Also note that files matching patterns in the
'MANIFEST.SKIP' file will not be included. Cool.

<h1>Installing our package</h1>

<p>(See also the <a href="admin.html">Administrator's Guide to
OpenInteract</a>.)

<p>
This is the sequence of commands that will install our package
(together with the output):

<p>The package is installed now. After restarting the Apache server,
typing in the URL we provided above ('fruit' from the
<code>conf/action.perl</code> we edited above) shows our modest fruit
assembly. See how easy it is to prepare dynamic web pages with
OpenInteract.

<h1>The next steps - Suggested Readings</h1>

<p>For any real-world application, you will obviously have to do
better than our little fruit example.  But you are a developer. We
will not insult your intelligence by providing you with hundreds of
pages of little modifications to our fruit example. You now need to
dive into the details. Here's how to.

<p>Read more documentation (see the online system documentation in
your installation - you can get it by clicking on the "System
Documentation" tab in the Admin Tools section once you get
OpenInteract running. If you don't, see the podfiles in the various
packages.)
