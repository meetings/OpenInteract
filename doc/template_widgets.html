    <h1>OpenInteract: Template Widgets</h1>

      <p>As of version 1.30, OpenInteract supports the idea of
      template widgets. A widget is a common element into which you
      can just plug in text or parameters to customize it. For
      example, an 'INPUT' element of type 'TEXT' is a particular type
      of widget -- you can customize its size, name, and default value.</p>

      <p>Widgets can also include other widgets. Such as a row that
      uses the 'INPUT TEXT' widget described above to create a labeled
      input field, with a label on the left and the input widget on
      the right.</p>

      <p>One of the main benefits of using these over HTML is that
      these are centralized -- a change in one place enacts changes
      throughout your site. All column headers can look a certain way
      and be changed easily, all textboxes can be consistent and you
      can create widgets specific to your site and needs -- such as
      for inputting dates or money, or displaying addresses-- for a
      consistent user interface.</p>

      <p>Here's an example:</p>

      <table border="0" bgcolor="#eeeeee">
      <tr><td>
<pre>
[%########################################
  form_text( name, value, size, maxlength, field_label )
     Generate a simple text field.

     Defaults:

        size      = 20
        maxlength = 50
  ########################################-%]

[%- DEFAULT size      = 20;
    DEFAULT maxlength = 50; -%]
[%- field_pre_label -%]
&lt;input type="text" name="[% name %]" value="[% value %]"
       size="[% size %]" maxlength="[% maxlength %]"&gt;
[%- field_label -%]
</pre>
      </td></tr>
      </table>

      <p>And you would reference this like:</p>

      <table border="0" bgcolor="#eeeeee">
      <tr><td>
<pre>
[% INCLUDE form_text( name = "batting_average", value = ".389" size = 5 ) -%]
</pre>
      </td></tr>
      </table>

      <p>And when the template is processed, get in return:</p>

      
      <table border="0" bgcolor="#eeeeee">
      <tr><td>
<pre>
&lt;input type="text" name="batting_average" value=".389"
       size="5" maxlength="50"&gt;
</pre>
      </td></tr>
      </table>

      <p>Calling widgets from other widgets is just as simple:</p>

      <table border="0" bgcolor="#eeeeee">
      <tr><td>
<pre>
[%########################################
  label_form_text_row( label, count, name, value, field_label )
     Display a row to input text: label on left, text input on right.

     Defaults:

        colspan = 2
  ########################################-%]

[%- DEFAULT colspan = 2; -%]  
[%- INCLUDE label_row_begin( colspan = 1 ) -%]
[%- INCLUDE data_cell_begin %][% INCLUDE form_text %]
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
</pre>
      </td></tr>
      </table>

      <p>Here we call three separate items, two of which
      ('label_row_begin' and 'data_cell_begin') aren't really
      'widgets' but rather just named areas for common code. This
      might be called:</p>

      <table border="0" bgcolor="#eeeeee">
      <tr><td>
<pre>
[% INCLUDE label_form_text_row( label = 'Batting Average', name = 'batting_average',
                                value = '.389', size = 5 ) -%]
</pre>
      </td></tr>
      </table>

      <p>And result in:</p>

      <table border="0" bgcolor="#eeeeee">
      <tr><td>
<pre>
&lt;tr valign="middle"&gt;
  &lt;td align="right"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Batting Average&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td align="right"&gt;
    &lt;input type="text" name="batting_average" value=".389"
           size="5" maxlength="50"&gt;
  &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
</pre>
      </td></tr>
      </table>

      <p>And you're not restricted to simple fill-in elements
      either. You can represent a common data-oriented widget -- such
      as a drop-down box representing countries your company services
      -- in this manner as well. Here's how such a call might
      look:</p>

      <table border="0" bgcolor="#eeeeee">
      <tr><td>
<pre>
[%# Use USA as default, antagonizing the rest of the world...-%]
[%- picked_country = user.country || 'United States' -%]
[% INCLUDE label_form_country_select( label = 'Countries', name = 'country',
                                      picked = picked_country ) -%]
</pre>
      </td></tr>
      </table>

      <p>Using this, the page designer doesn't care how many countries
      the company services, whether a new one has been added to the
      list, etc. Just make the call and the graphic element will be
      created the same way every time.</p>

      <p>Using these template widgets you can build a library of
      display elements very quickly.</p>

      <h1>What widgets are included?</h1>

      <p>As of version 1.30, OpenInteract comes with the following
      widgets:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>data_cell_begin</li>
        <li>form_checkbox</li>
        <li>form_hidden</li>
        <li>form_radio</li>
        <li>form_select</li>
        <li>form_select_intro</li>
        <li>form_select_option</li>
        <li>form_select_options_iterator</li>
        <li>form_select_options_list</li>
        <li>form_submit</li>
        <li>form_submit_row</li>
        <li>form_text</li>
        <li>form_textarea</li>
        <li>header_cell</li>
        <li>header_row</li>
        <li>label_form_checkbox_row</li>
        <li>label_form_radio_row</li>
        <li>label_form_select_row</li>
        <li>label_form_textarea_row</li>
        <li>label_form_text_row</li>
        <li>label_row</li>
        <li>label_row_begin</li>
        <li>label_text_row</li>
        <li>row_color</li>
        <li>search_results_page_listing</li>
        <li>show_label</li>
        <li>table_bordered_begin</li>
        <li>table_bordered_end</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Every website has its own copy of the widgets in the website
      <tt>template/</tt> directory, so if you want to modify the
      appearance of any of these items, you can. For instance, if you
      want to pass in a Spanish equivalent for labels, you can modify
      'show_label', which is currently the ultra-simple:</p>

      <table border="0" bgcolor="#eeeeee">
      <tr><td>
<pre>
[%########################################
  show_label( label )
     Display a label.
  ########################################-%]
&lt;b&gt;[% label %]&lt;/b&gt;
</pre>
      </td></tr>
      </table>

      <p>with:</p>

     <table border="0" bgcolor="#eeeeee">
      <tr><td>
<pre>
[%########################################
  show_label( label, spanish )
     Display a label (displaying spanish version if available)
  ########################################-%]
&lt;b&gt;[% label %]&lt;/b&gt; [% IF spanish %](&lt;em&gt;[% spanish %]&lt;em&gt;)[% END -%]
</pre>
      </td></tr>
      </table>


      <h1>How are widgets included?</h1>

      <p>When you create a website you have a number of widgets
      installed by default in the <code>$WEBSITE_DIR/template</code>
      directory. These widgets will never be overwritten unless you
      ask them to be (via the <code>oi_manage refresh_widget</code>
      command) and they are specific to your website. You can add new
      ones, remove existing ones -- whatever you like</p>

      <p>If you have an existing website and want the widgets with OI
      1.30+, just run:</p>

      <pre>
       $ export OIWEBSITE=/path/to/my/website
       $ oi_manage refresh_widget
      </pre>


      <h1>Gotchas</h1>

      <p>The Template Toolkit docs warn about this, but it's worth
      reiterating. You can use either the <tt>INCLUDE</tt> or
      <tt>PROCESS</tt> directives to run these widgets. The difference
      between them is subtle.</p>

      <ul>

        <li><tt>INCLUDE</tt> ensures that variables you modify within
        the widget (even with a <tt>DEFAULT</tt>) are localized to the
        widget.</li>

        <li><tt>PROCESS</tt> does not localize variables within the
        widget -- any changes you make in the widget are propogated
        outside the widget.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>For instance, say you have the following:</p>

<pre>
      [% PROCESS form_text( name = 'this', value = 'that' ) %]
      [% PROCESS form_select( name = 'them', list = object_list,
                              value_field = 'id', label_field = 'full_name' ) %]
</pre>

      <p>You'd be extremely surprised to find your SELECT box being 20
      rows long! that's because inside the 'form_text' widget there's
      a statement:</p>

<pre>
      [% DEFAULT size = 20 %]
</pre>

      <p>Since we didn't pass any value for 'size' into 'form_text',
      it's set to 20. But the tricky part is that this value is
      <b>also</b> passed into the 'form_select' widget since it's in
      our environment and we didn't pass it explicitly in the
      <tt>PROCESS</tt> call.</p>

      <p>You could argue that instead of using <tt>DEFAULT</tt> we
      should do something like:</p>

<pre>
      [% text_size = size || 20 %]
</pre>

      <p>So that the common variable 'size' isn't set as a
      side-effect. And that's a valid argument. But then as a widget
      writer you have to have knowledge of the variables the other
      widgets are using. And as a widget user you have to have
      knowledge of what happens inside the widget.</p>

      <p>With these potential pitfalls, why use <tt>PROCESS</tt> at
      all? The Template Toolkit manual states that using
      <tt>PROCESS</tt> is a little faster. So you have a trade-off to
      make: a little speed for knowledge that things will work like
      you think they will.</p>

      <p>The template widgets shipped with OpenInteract fall on the
      side of being able to sleep at night -- every widget works like
      you think it should. (Or at least how <b>someone</b> thought it
      should.) You can always change them for you site if you like, but
      we've found it's better to use <tt>INCLUDE</tt> and not deal
      with the potential headaches. If you're sure the widget won't
      have any side effects -- that it doesn't have any
      <tt>DEFAULT</tt> or other variable modification statements --
      then go ahead and use <tt>PROCESS</tt>.</p>
