      <h1>OpenInteract and LDAP</h1>
      
      <p>With <tt>OpenInteract</tt> 1.2 and <tt>SPOPS</tt> 0.50, you
      can now use LDAP not only as a datastore for your objects, but
      also for authenticating users and determining group
      membership. This document explains how.</p>

      <p>If you can, read this document and follow its instructions
      before you install and use OpenInteract. Otherwise actions like
      schema changes can become more difficult.</p>

      <h1>The Pieces</h1>

      <ul>

        <li><tt>SPOPS::LDAP</tt> provides the serialization logic and
        behavior</li>

        <li><tt>OpenInteract::LDAP</tt> provides centralized
        connection management</li>

        <li><tt>OpenInteract::SPOPS::LDAP</tt> should be the parent of
        any OI LDAP data object class.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>Additionally, two packages (base_group and base_user) offer
      options for storing users and groups in LDAP and doing
      authentication from there. See below for more.</p>

      <h1>Overall Configuration</h1>

      <p>First, install <tt>SPOPS</tt> version 0.50 or higher and run
      its tests to ensure that the LDAP portion (<tt>SPOPS::LDAP</tt>)
      is functioning properly with your LDAP server.</p>

      <p>Next, install <tt>OpenInteract</tt> 1.2 or higher. This
      includes functionality to manage multiple datasources and
      connect to LDAP directories.</p>

      <p>Next, make the following modifications to the server
      configuration file:</p>

      <ul>

        <li>Add relevant connection information to the
        <tt>{ldap_info}</tt> key. This describes one or more LDAP
        datasources you will use with your system. The usual suspects
        -- host, port, base DN -- are there, and you can provide a
        standard bind DN and password as well. (Examples below.)</li>

        <li>Set the key <tt>{datasource}{default_connection_ldap}</tt>
        to the connection to be used when an LDAP object doesn't
        specify a datasource.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>You can test your connection information from
      <tt>oi_manage</tt>:</p>

        <pre>$ oi_manage --website_dir=/path/to/mysite test_ldap</pre>

      <p>This will go through each of the defined datasources and try
      to connect and bind given the information in the server
      configuration file.</p>

      <h1>User/Group Storage and Authentication</h1>

      <p>Storing users and groups for use in OpenInteract
      authentication makes things a little trickier. This is supported
      but still in its infancy, so you might scare up a few gotchas
      here and there.</p>

      <p>You should only need to do the following:</p>

      <ul>

        <li>Modify the SPOPS configuration files for both users
        (<tt>base_user-x.xx/conf/spops.perl</tt>) and groups
        (<tt>base_group-x.xx/conf/spops.perl</tt>) or use and tweak
        the ones supplied under the same path but named
        <tt>spops.perl.ldap</tt>.</li>

        <li>(slight hack) Create an empty hashref in your
        <tt>base_user-x.xx/conf/spops.perl</tt> file for the key
        'has_a'. It should look like this:

<pre>
  'has_a' => {},
</pre>

        This is to get around the information being inherited by the
        parent configuration and will be fixed in a later version.</li>

        <li>(slight hack) Create an empty hashref in your
        <tt>base_group-x.xx/conf/spops.perl</tt> file for the key
        'links_to'. It should look like this:

<pre>
  'links_to' => {},
</pre>

        This is to get around the information being inherited by the
        parent configuration and will be fixed in a later version.</li>

        <li>Change the key <tt>{login}-&gt;{crypt_password}</tt> to
        '0' (LDAP takes care of this for you)</li>

        <li>Modify the server configuration file to set the values for
        both the <tt>{id}-&gt;{user_type}</tt> and
        <tt>{id}-&gt;{group_type}</tt> keys to 'char'. Do this before
        installing OpenInteract since these keys inform the datatypes
        of other tables, such as <tt>sys_error</tt> which stores
        errors..</li>

        <li>Modify the server configuration file to set the values for
        the system users and groups. You can map these to existing
        users or create new ones. The keys you'll need to modify are:

        <p><tt>{default_objects}-&gt;{superuser}<br>
              {default_objects}-&gt;{supergroup}<br>
              {default_objects}-&gt;{public_group}<br>
              {default_objects}-&gt;{site_admin_group}</tt></p>

        <p>See the discussion about 'Object Security' below for more
        information about this.</p>

        </li>

        <li>Note that the 'sasl' key in the <tt>{ldap_info}-&gt;{
        $datasource }</tt> entry has not yet been tested, primarily
        because we need to setup a development server that has
        SASL/CRAM-MD5 support properly compiled in..</li>

      </ul>

      <p>If you're having issues authenticating, try the following
      simple script, setting the variables to appropriate values:</p>

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use Net::LDAP;

my $host          = 'localhost';
my $port          = 389;
my $bind_dn       = 'cn=Manager,dc=MyCompany,dc=com';

my $bind_password = 'password';

my $ldap = Net::LDAP->new( $host, port => 389 );
die "Cannot make LDAP connection\n" unless ( $ldap );

my $ldap_msg = $ldap->bind( dn => $bind_dn, password => $bind_password );
if ( my $code = $ldap_msg->code ) {
    die "Error during bind (Code: $code)\n", $ldap_msg->error, "\n";
}
print "Connect/bind ok.";
</pre>

      <h1>Object Security</h1>


      <h2>Security for Existing Data</h2>

      <p>You might be using LDAP because you have a directory of
      existing information. If you are doing this, then you need to
      tell OpenInteract about the security for the objects already in
      the system.</p>

      <p>The 'base_security' package has a script for automating this
      fairly common action. You'll need to run the script
      'create_object_security.pl' found in that package. Here's a sample:</p>

<pre>
 $ export OIWEBSITE=/path/to/mysite
 $ cd pkg/base_security-1.xx/script
 $ perl create_object_security.pl \
      --class=MyClass::User \
      --scope=world \
      --level=read
 $ perl create_object_security.pl \
      --class=MyClass::User \
      --scope=group \
      --scope_id='site admin' \
      --level=write
 $ perl create_object_security.pl \
      --class=MyClass::Group \
      --scope=world \
      --level=read
 $ perl create_object_security.pl \
      --class=MyClass::Group \
      --scope=group \
      --scope_id='site admin' \
      --level=write
</pre>

      <p>You will have to modify 'MyClass::' to your website's
      namespace and 'site admin' to the ID of your site admin group --
      whatever you set in the
      <tt>{default_objects}{site_admin_group}</tt> key of your server
      configuration.</p>

      <p>These commands will create entries in the security table so
      that the 'world' security for all users and groups is 'read' and
      that the site admin group has read/write privileges to all users
      and groups.</p>

      <p>Run the script with the parameter '--help' to get more
      information about how to run it.</p>


      <h2>Object Creation Security</h2>

      <p>For objects that use security you will need to make a
      modification to each object's entry in its conf/spops.perl
      file. For instance, the default security for a lot of objects is
      specified by something like:</p>

<pre>
 creation_security => {
    u => undef,
    g => { 3 => 'WRITE' },
    w => 'READ',
 },
</pre>

      <p>The '3' in this refers to the 'site admin' group, which is
      you use DBI as a backend for users and groups will always be
      true.</p>

      <p>With LDAP, you'll need to change this to be the same as the
      value you specified in the
      <tt>{default_objects}{site_admin_group}</tt> key in your server
      configuration file.</p>

      <p>So assuming you are using 'site admin' as the cn for the site
      administration group, it might look something like:</p>

<pre>
 creation_security => {
    u => undef,
    g => { 'site admin' => 'WRITE' },
    w => 'READ',
 },
</pre>

      <p>This will probably be handled automatically in a future
      OpenInteract release. In the meantime, you'll have to change it
      manually for every object using security in the system. To get a
      listing of them, go to the URL <tt>/Security/</tt> in your OI
      site. All the items in the 'Object Classes' list with 'Secure'
      in the 'Base Security' column need to be modified in this manner.</p>
      

      <h1>Server Configuration Examples</h1>

      <p>The following defines two connections: 'main' and 'auth'. The
      first describes a connection using an anonymous bind, while the
      second specifies a bind DN and password. The second also uses a
      different port than the first.</p>

<pre>
     'default_connection_ldap' => 'main',
     'ldap_info' => {
           main => {
              host          => 'ldap.myco.com',
              port          => 389,
              bind_dn       => undef,
              bind_password => undef,
              base_dn       => 'dc=MyCo,dc=com',
              timeout       => 120,
              version       => 2,
              sasl          => 0,
              debug         => 0,
           },
           auth => {
              host          => 'ldap.myco.com',
              port          => 3890,
              bind_dn       => 'cn=Manager,dc=MyCo,dc=com',,
              bind_password => 'crystalline',
              base_dn       => 'dc=MyCo,dc=com',
              timeout       => 120,
              version       => 2,
              sasl          => 0,
              debug         => 0,
           },
     },
</pre>

      <h1>Object Configuration Examples</h1>

      <p>Here's a sample configuration, from the 'base_user'
      package. One important thing to note: you <b>do not</b> need to
      use a full DN for <tt>{ldap_base_dn}</tt> --
      <tt>OpenInteract::SPOPS::LDAP</tt> overrides the method
      <tt>base_dn()</tt> and prepends the value from
      <tt>{ldap_base_dn}</tt> to the value from <tt>{base_dn}</tt> in
      your datasource.</p>

      <p>So if we were to use the example below with the 'main'
      datasource, the base DN of these objects would be:</p>

<pre>
  ou=People                --> From the object
+ dc=MyCo,dc=com           --> From the 'main' datasource
================
  ou=People,dc=MyCo,dc=com --> Base DN used
</pre>

      <p>If you're using multiple datasources, <tt>{ldap_base_dn}</tt>
      needs to be a hashref with the keys as datasources and the
      values as the partial base DN for that datasource. See
      <tt>SPOPS::LDAP::MultiDatasource</tt> for more information.</p>

<pre>
   'user' => {
     class        => 'OpenInteract::User',
     code_class   => 'OpenInteract::User::LDAP',
     isa          => [ qw/ OpenInteract::User OpenInteract::SPOPS::LDAP  
                           SPOPS::Utility SPOPS::Secure SPOPS::LDAP / ],
     field        => [ qw/ cn sn givenname mail userpassword uid objectclass / ],
     field_map    => { 'last_name' => 'sn', 'first_name' => 'givenname',
                       'password' => 'userpassword', 'login_name' => 'uid',
                       'email' => 'mail', user_id => 'uid' },
     multivalue   => [ 'objectclass' ],
     id_field     => 'cn',
     ldap_base_dn => 'ou=People',
     ldap_object_class => [ qw/ top person inetOrgPerson organizationalPerson / ],
     ldap_fetch_object_class => 'person',
     alias        => [],
     has_a        => {},
     links_to     => { 'OpenInteract::Group' => 'uniquemember' },
     fetch_by     => [],
     creation_security => { 
        u => undef,
        g   => { 3 => 'WRITE' },
        w   => 'READ',
     },
     track        => { create => 0, update => 1, remove => 1 },
     display      => { url => '/User/show/' },
     name         => sub { return $_[0]->full_name },
     object_name  => 'User',
  },
</pre>

      <h1>Multiple Datasources</h1>

      <p>You can use multiple datasources in two different ways</p>

      <ol>

        <li>Use multiple datasources for the same class. This enables
        you to search for an entry once and have the search get
        executed on multiple directories. Read about how this works
        and how you set it up in
        <tt>SPOPS::LDAP::MultiDatasource</tt></li>

        <li>Use a single datasource per a class but have multiple
        directories available. For instance, you might run one LDAP
        directory for all equipment in your organization and another
        for all employees and groups.

          <p>For this, you simply need to configure all datasources in
          your server configuration, then tell each SPOPS class which
          datasource it should use. To tell a class, you need to use
          the <tt>{datasource}</tt> key in its configuration:</p>

<pre>
$config = {
   class      => 'My::Equipment',
   isa        => [ 'SPOPS::LDAP' ],
   datasource => 'equipment',
};
</pre>

          <p>This class would use the connection information stored
          under the key 'equipment' in your server configuration.</p>

          <p>There are other configuration details to be aware of --
          please see <tt>SPOPS::LDAP::MultiDatasource</tt> for more
          infromation.</p>

      </ol>
