<P>OpenInteract Packages - Managing and distributing applications</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</A></H1>
<P>This document describes the packaging system in OpenInteract.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="introduction">INTRODUCTION</A></H1>
<P>A package is all the code, SQL structures, configuration information
and anything else necessary to implement functionality in
OpenInteract.</P>
<P>In OpenInteract, packages implement the actual application
functionality. OpenInteract handles the storage interface (e.g.,
putting your objects in a database), dispatches URL requests to your
objects (this is called <EM>handling</EM> an <EM>action</EM>), security,
authentication and authorization, and session management.</P>
<P>Applications need to define objects, which is how an application
handles its state. It also needs to define how the objects are to be
manipulated, which users can access them and how functionality is
exposed to the user (by way of a URL to action mapping).</P>
<P>Obviously, OpenInteract comes with tools to install, uninstall and
query currently installed packages. This greatly simplifies the task
of creating, testing and distributing your application.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="package contents">PACKAGE CONTENTS</A></H1>
<P>What goes into a package? In general, you will find:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Perl module code: This can include handler code, SPOPS object code and
installation code.
<P></P>
<LI>
Configuration: Generally this includes two files in the <CODE>conf/</CODE>
directory: <CODE>action.perl</CODE> and <CODE>spops.perl</CODE>, both of which are
discussed further below.
<P></P>
<LI>
Templates and Components: Graphical interface to package
functionality. Normally these are HTML files interspersed with
template processing commands which makes the data the package manages
visible to the user.
<P></P>
<LI>
Installation information: This includes the <CODE>package.conf</CODE> file along
with the SQL installation class.
<P></P>
<LI>
Package data structures and data: These are used by the SQL
installation class to install tables and any initial data needed by
the package. These data can also be installed to other tables in
OpenInteract.
<P></P>
<LI>
Documentation: The 'create_skeleton' command of <CODE>oi_manage</CODE> will
create a preliminary POD file for you which documents your
package. You are strongly encouraged to fill in the blanks and add
meaningful detail along with any other necessary files to let people
know what functionality your package provides.
<P></P></UL>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="how do i create a package">HOW DO I CREATE A PACKAGE?</A></H1>
<P>The <CODE>oi_manage</CODE> script included with OpenInteract will create a basic
package skeleton for you. Here's an example:</P>
<PRE>
 oi_manage --package=mypackage --base_dir=/tmp/OpenInteract \
           create_skeleton</PRE>
<P>Will create the following files:</P>
<PRE>
 mypackage                      # Main directory
 mypackage/package.conf         # Basic package configuration (name, ...)
 mypackage/MANIFEST             # List of files in package
 mypackage/MANIFEST.SKIP        # Regexes to skip when creating MANIFEST
 mypackage/conf                 # Configuration directory
 mypackage/conf/spops.perl      # Persistent object(s) configuration
 mypackage/conf/action.perl     # Action(s) configuration
 mypackage/data                 # Package data/security directory
 mypackage/doc                  # Documentation directory
 mypackage/doc/mypackage.pod    # Starter documentation
 mypackage/doc/titles           # Map documentation name to subject
 mypackage/struct               # Package table definition directory
 mypackage/template             # Template directory
 mypackage/script               # Tools program directory
 mypackage/html                 # Static html directory
 mypackage/html/images          # Image directory
 mypackage/OpenInteract         # Object hierarchy directory
 mypackage/OpenInteract/Handler # Package handler directory</PRE>
<P>You will normally need to edit/add the following:</P>
<PRE>
 mypackage/package.conf         # Add name, version, author information
 mypackage/MANIFEST             # Add names of distribution files
 mypackage/conf/spops.perl      # Describe the objects your package uses
 mypackage/conf/action.perl     # Map URLs to handlers in your package
 mypackage/data                 # Specify the initial data and security
 mypackage/struct               # Describe the tables used to store your objects
 mypackage/template             # HTML to display and manipulate your objects
 mypackage/OpenInteract         # Optional Perl modules defining object behavior
 mypackage/OpenInteract/Handler # Manipulate objects for desired functionality
 mypackage/doc/mypackage.pod    # Last but not least, tell the world about it</PRE>
<P>By the way, the MANIFEST file can be created automatically. (Perl is
great.) Here's how:</P>
<PRE>
 &gt;&gt; cd /path/to/mypackage
 &gt;&gt; perl -MExtUtils::Manifest -e 'ExtUtils::Manifest::mkmanifest()'</PRE>
<P>That's it! If you have an old 'MANIFEST' file in the directory it will
be copied to 'MANIFEST.bak'. Also note that files matching patterns in
the 'MANIFEST.SKIP' file will not be included.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="what's in a package object">WHAT'S IN A PACKAGE OBJECT?</A></H1>
<P>Now that you've created a package already, you've seen most of its
contents. (The ones you care about, anyway.) However, each package is
a <CODE>OpenInteract::Package</CODE> object -- a normal SPOPS object.</P>
<P>OpenInteract maintains a registry of installed packages in a central
location. (To find the file, go to the <CODE>conf/</CODE> directory of your base
OpenInteract installation. The <CODE>package_install.gdbm</CODE> holds the
information.)</P>
<P>This registry includes meta information about all currently installed
packages -- author, install date, version, etc. You can browse the
information using a command-line tool (named <CODE>oi_manage</CODE>) to see what
is currently installed, along with querying the information to find
dependencies, authors, etc.</P>
<P><STRONG>Properties of the OpenInteract::Package object:</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>version</STRONG> ($)</P>
<P>Version of package</P>
<P><STRONG>author</STRONG> (\@)</P>
