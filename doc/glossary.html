    <dl>
      <dt>action</dt>

        <dd>An action is a configuration directive that maps a URL to
        a handler. You setup actions within a package in the
        <code>action.perl</code> file, and default actions are defined
        in the <code>server.perl</code> file.</dd>

      <dt>base installation</dt>

      <dd>An OpenInteract base installation is where all versions of
      all installed packages live. When you create a website or apply
      a package, the original source for the package lives in the base
      installation. One base installation can support many separate
      websites, and you should only ever need to create the base
      installation once.</dd>

      <dt>handler</dt>

        <dd>A handler is a piece of Perl code that ultimately returns
        a fragment of HTML, or more generally, text. The handler
        manages action security and manipulates objects (fetches,
        creates, saves, removes) and hands the data to the template
        for display.</dd>

      <dt>package</dt>

        <dd>Unit of distribution for a given functionality. This
        includes all of the necessary configuration, templates, Perl
        code, etc. You can install, upgrade and remove packages to or
        from your website. You configure a package using the
        <code>action.perl</code> and <code>spops.perl</code> files.</dd>

      <dt>server</dt>

        <dd>An Apache/mod_perl process that runs the code making up
        one or more websites. You configure the server using
        <code>httpd.conf</code> and <code>httpd_modperl.conf</code> files.</dd>

      <dt>stash class</dt>

        <dd>A stash class is Perl code that holds objects and other
        information for a website from request to request. Every
        website has its own stash class. (Not to be confused with Perl
        package symbol tables.)</dd>

      <dt>template</dt>

        <dd>A template is a piece of text that contains template
        processing directives interspersed with other text. Normally
        in OpenInteract, this will be Template Toolkit processing
        directives interspersed with HTML.</dd>

      <dt>tool</dt>

        <dd>Loosely speaking, a package implements a tool. This is not
        exactly true, since a package can choose to implement more
        than one tool. In general, you will find that there is a
        one-to-one mapping between a package and a tool. A tool
        consists of a set of templates that manipulate a common set of
        objects.</dd>

      <dt>website</dt>

        <dd>An instantiation of the base OpenInteract framework plus a
        set of user-defined packages. You configure the website using
        the <code>server.perl</code> file.</dd>
