    <h1>Caching in OpenInteract</h1>

    <p>As of version <b>1.51</b>, caching of generated content is
    supported in OpenInteract. This can provide a dramatic speedup to
    content that has a lot of template processing. Caching of SPOPS
    objects is not officially supported yet.</p>

    There are two different levels of caching for content in
    OpenInteract:

    <ul>
      <li>Templates: Once a template has been parsed we don't want to
      repeat the actions again</li>

      <li>Content: Once a component has been generated with a
      particular set of parameters, we don't want to regenerate it
      again.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>Fortunately, the first one is done in the Template Toolkit and
    in the OpenInteract implementation for the provider. How to
    control this from OpenInteract is discussed briefly below. The
    authoritative voice on Template Toolkit caching is in the
    excellent TT documentation.</p>

    <h1>Content Caching</h1>

    <p>Content caching is still fairly young in OpenInteract, and it's
    not appropriate (or useful) for all purposes. It's best when used
    on pages that contain a lot of data or require a good deal of
    processing.</p>

    <h2>Global Configuration</h2>

    <p>The following keys in your server configuration are used in
    caching:</p>

    <ul>

      <li><tt>dir.cache_content</tt>: The directory where we put the
      cached content. This is normally
      <tt>$WEBSITE_DIR/cache/content</tt>.</li>

      <li><tt>cache_info.data.cleanup</tt>: If true we delete and
      recreate the cache directory every time the server starts
      up. This is recommended.</li>

      <li><tt>cache_info.data.use</tt>: If set to true, content
      caching is enabled; if set to false, it is disabled.</li>

      <li><tt>cache_info.data.default_expire</tt>: number of seconds
      used for the cached content expiration. You can override this on
      a case-by-case basis.</li>

      <li><tt>cache_info.data.class</tt>: Cache implementation to
      use. Currently only <tt>OpenInteract::Cache::File</tt> is
      supported.</tt>

      <li><tt>cache_info.data.max_size</tt>: Max size the cache should
      be allowed to grow, in bytes.</tt>

      <li><tt>cache_info.data.directory_depth</tt>: If you find that
      retrieving cached content is slow because of the number of items
      in a particular directory, increase this number.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Identifying Cached Data</h2>

    <p>Each piece of cached data needs to be uniquely identified. We
    use two pieces of information for this: a basic key and a set of
    parameters and values. For instance, you can cache a listing of
    news entries but there can be multiple types of listings depending
    on the news section the user filters by. So your information would
    be:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>basic key</b>: 'news_listing'</li>
      <li><b>parameters</b>: value of section used as filter</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We describe below how to set this up.</p>

    <h1>How to Setup</h1>

    <p>Here are the four requirements for caching content:</p>

    <p><b>First</b>: your handler needs to subclass either
    <tt>OpenInteract::Handler::GenericDispatcher</tt> or
    <tt>OpenInteract::CommonHandler</tt>. (Most handlers already do
    this so it's not much of a burden.)</p>

    <p><b>Second</b>: caching must be configured in your action using
    the parameter <tt>cache_key</tt> and, optionally,
    <tt>cache_expire</tt>.</p>

    <p><b>Third</b>: you must explicitly check in your handler to see
    if there is cached content.</p>

    <p><b>Fourth</b>: you must call a new method to generate the
    content.</p>

    <h2>Handler Parents</h2>

    <p>Just do one of the following, assuming your handler is named
    <tt>MySite::Handler::MyHandler</tt>:</p>

    <p><tt>use base qw( OpenInteract::Handler::GenericDispatcher );</tt></p>
    <p><tt>use base qw( OpenInteract::CommonHandler );</tt></p>
    <p><tt>@MySite::Handler::MyHandler::ISA = qw( OpenInteract::Handler::GenericDispatcher );</tt></p>
    <p><tt>@MySite::Handler::MyHandler::ISA = qw( OpenInteract::CommonHandler );</tt></p>

    <h2>Action Configuration</h2>

    <p>Each method has its own basic key. This key is used along with
    parameters to uniquely identify the cached content so it can be
    retrieved properly. In your action configuration you set the basic
    key for each method that is going to produce cached content. For
    instance, here we set the key for the method 'listing':</p>

    <pre>
     mypkg/conf/action.perl
     ----------------------------------------
     $action = {
        myaction => {
           class    => 'OpenInteract::Handler::MyHandler',
           security => 'no',
           cache_key => {
               listing => 'myaction::listing',
           },
        },
     };
     </pre>

    <p>You can also set expiration times here. These will override the
    setting in the server configuration under
    <tt>cache_info.data.default_expire</tt>:

    <pre>
     mypkg/conf/action.perl
     ----------------------------------------
     $action = {
        myaction => {
           class    => 'OpenInteract::Handler::MyHandler',
           security => 'no',
           cache_key => {
               listing => 'myaction::listing',
           },
           cache_expire => {
               listing => 1800,
           },
        },
     };
     </pre>

    <h2>Checking for Cached Content</h2>

    <p>Every handler deriving from
    <tt>OpenInteract::Handler::GenericDispatcher</tt> gains the method
    <tt>check_cache()</tt>. Here is a typical call:</p>

    <pre>
    sub listing {
        my ( $class, $p ) = @_;
        my $R = OpenInteract::Request->instance;
        my $num_items = $R->apache->param( 'num_items' )
                        || DEFAULT_NUM_ITEMS;
        my %cache_params = ( num_items => $num_items );
        my $cached = $class->check_cache( $p, \%cache_params );
        return $cached if ( $cached );
    }
    </pre>

    <p>Here we are saying that the cached content depends on the
    number of items requested. Once we have that information we can
    check to see if there is anything in the cache matching it.</p>

    <p>It's necessary to pass <tt>$p</tt> to the caching methods since
    our handlers are class methods rather than objects. If they were
    objects we could save the action state in them. As it is, we need
    to work around it. The next version of OpenInteract makes these
    full-fledged objects.</p>

    <h2>Generating Content for the Cache</h2>

    <p>Every handler deriving from
    <tt>OpenInteract::Handler::GenericDispatcher</tt> also gains the
    method <tt>generate content()</tt>. Here is a typical call (the
    first part is copied from above):</p>

    <pre>
    sub listing {
        my ( $class, $p ) = @_;
        my $R = OpenInteract::Request->instance;
        my $num_items = $R->apache->param( 'num_items' )
                        || DEFAULT_NUM_ITEMS;
        my %cache_params = ( num_items => $num_items );
        my $cached = $class->check_cache( $p, \%cache_params );
        return $cached if ( $cached );
        my $item_list = $R->item->fetch_group({ limit => $num_items,
                                                order => 'created_on DESC' });
        my %vars = ( item_list => $item_list );
        return $class->generate_content( $p, \%cache_params, \%vars,
                                         { name => 'mypkg::mytmpl' } );
    }
    </pre>

    <p>Previously we might have called for the return statement:</p>

    <pre>
        return $R->template->handler( {}, \%vars,
                                      { name => 'mypkg::mytmpl' } );
    </pre>

    <p>There are three differences -- besides the name! -- between
    these two statements:</p>

    <ul>

      <li>We have jettisoned the first argument to
      <tt>$R-&gt;template-&gt;handler()</tt>, since it was rarely used.</li>

      <li>We have passed the hashref <tt>$p</tt> as the first
      argument.</li>

      <li>We have passed a hashref of parameters (<tt>\%vars</tt>) OI
      will use to cache the content. Note that these are the same
      parameters we used in the <tt>check_cache()</tt> call
      above.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Clearing the Cache</h2>

    <p>You have the option of clearing the cache whenever you
    manipulate data. For instance, if you edit the title of a news
    story you do not want the old title to appear in the story
    listing. And if you delete a story and mark it as inactive because
    it's inappropriate, you do not want it in your headline listing.</p>

    <p>So whenever you modify data, it's normally best to call
    <tt>clear_cache()</tt>. This method is inherited from
    <tt>OpenInteract::Handler::GenericDispatcher</tt> like the
    others. Here's an example:</p>

    <pre>
    sub edit {
        my ( $class, $p ) = @_;
        my $R = OpenInteract::Request->instance;
        my $thingy_id = $R->apache->param( 'thingy_id' );
        my $thingy = $R->thingy->fetch( $thingy_id );
        $thingy->{foo} = $R->apache->param( 'foo' );
        eval { $thingy->save };
        if ( $@ ) {
            return $class->listing({ error_msg => "Blarg: $@" });
        }
        else {
            $class->clear_cache();
            return $class->listing({ status_msg => 'Cool' });
        }
    }
    </pre>

    <p>So when the 'listing' method is called after a successful
    <tt>save()</tt> on the object, the previously cached content will
    have been deleted and the content will be regenerated anew.</p>

    <h2>When Not to Cache</h2>

    <p>If you're an admin user you frequently see functionality that
    normal users do not see: <b>Edit</b> or <b>Remove</b> links next
    to an object, etc. You do not want to cache this content, since
    users shouldn't see this information. (Normal users modifying the
    object shouldn't be an issue, since security should take care of
    it.)</p>

    <p>As a result, any user defined as an administrator will not view
    or save cached content. "Defined as an administrator" means that a
    call to the following will return true:</p>

    <pre>
    my $is_admin = $R->{auth}{is_admin};
    </pre>

    <h2>Example: news</h2>

    <p>The 'news' package shipped with OpenInteract has an
    implementation of caching that you can experiment with.</p>

    <h1>Template Caching</h1>

    <p>Instead of parsing a template every time you request it, the
    Template Toolkit (TT) will translate the template to Perl code
    and, if allowed, cache it in memory. Keeping templates in memory
    will make your website much faster.</p>

    <p>TT will also save your compiled template to the
    filesystem. This is useful for successive starts of your website
    -- if the template if found in the compile directory TT doesn't
    need to parse it again, even though you've stopped and restarted
    your server since it was first read.</p>

    <h2>Configuration</h2>

    <p>The following keys from your server configuration control
    caching and compiling:</p>

    <ul>

      seconds) for how long the templates remain cached in memory
      before they're reparsed.</li>

      <li><tt>template_info.cache_size</tt>: This is the main
      parameter, describing how many cached templates TT will hold in
      memory. The only restriction on a high value is your memory, so
      experiment with as high a number as possible.

      <p>If you set this to 0 then caching will be disabled. This is
      useful when you're doing debugging on your site, but it will
      make things noticably slower.</p></li>

      <li><tt>dir.cache_tt</tt>: The directory where we store the
      compiled templates in the filesystem. This is normally
      <tt>$WEBSITE_DIR/cache/tt</tt></li>

      <li><tt>cache_info.template.expire</tt>: Sets the expiration (in
      <li><tt>template_info.compile_cleanup</tt>: If set to a true
      value, we clean out the template compile directory when the
      Apache server starts up.</li>

      <li><tt>template_info.compile_ext</tt>: Extension of the file
      created when the template is compiled to the filesystem.</li>
      
    </ul>
