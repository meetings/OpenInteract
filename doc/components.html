<P>OpenInteract Guide to Components - Building big things from small pieces</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</A></H1>
<P>This document describes what a component is in OpenInteract as well as
how to create one.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="introduction">INTRODUCTION</A></H1>
<P>Almost all substantive websites have certain graphical (or textual)
items that are repeated on a large number of pages. These can be as
simple as a standard copyright notice, or as complicated as a list of
the most recent forum posts.</P>
<P>If you find yourself using something in a number of pages, odds are
that it can be represented as a component. It's a little more work in
the beginning, but it pays off great dividends the more pages in which
you use the component, and even greater if you ever have to modify it.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="what is a component">WHAT IS A COMPONENT?</A></H1>
<P>Most generally, a component is any aspect of your page that might be
used on more than one page. It can also be any aspect of your page
that you want to make separate so you can make your template
shorter. All components return fully-formed HTML.</P>
<P>A component can be very short or very long. It can be 100% static HTML
or have only enough HTML to format text on the page in a coherent
manner.</P>
<P>Technically, just about everything in OpenInteract is a
component. Even when you call a simple page that displays a form to
edit an object, you're calling a component. But for consistency, we
refer to more complicated components as 'handlers'.</P>
<P>In this idea of everything being a component, you can think of the
main template as a container for some text and placement of
components, which can themselves contain components, which can
themselves contain components...</P>
<P>The configuration file holds naming information for all
components. There are two basic types of components: template-only
components and those with code behind them. The difference in
configuration is covered below in <A HREF="#how to create a component">How to Create a Component</A>.</P>
<P>

<H1><A NAME="how to call a component">HOW TO CALL A COMPONENT</A></H1>
<P>Calling a component from a template is quite simple:</P>
<P><STRONG>Example: Calling a component</STRONG></P>
<P>This example is using the Template Toolkit processing engine (see
<CODE>OpenInteract::Template::Plugin</CODE> for how to call components).</P>
<PRE>
 [% OI.comp( 'component_name', param = value, param = value ... ) %]</PRE>
<P>The HTML returned by the component will be put in place of the
component call.</P>

<P>The 'component_name' is a valid OpenInteract <a
href="actions.html">action</a>. If you want to simply include a
template, you can use the syntax:</P>

<PRE>
 [% PROCESS mypkg::mytemplate %]</PRE>
<P>or with additional parameters:</P>
<PRE>
 [% PROCESS mypkg::mytemplate( foo = 'bar', baz = 42 ) %]</PRE>

<p>See <a href="templates.html">additional documentation on
templates</a> for more.</p>

<P><STRONG>Wrong component name</STRONG></P>
<P>If the component name is not found, the system will throw an error
with code 312 and return the string 'Error: Unknown component
called'. In the future, we'll probably make this message configurable.</P>

<P><STRONG>Passing parameters</STRONG></P>
<P>The parameters passed into the component follow many of the same rules
as in the templating module. However, since OpenInteract have the
standard of having a hashref as the first argument to a
handler/component, we massage the parameters a little bit.</P>
<P>Looking into the documentation for the Template Toolkit, you'll see
subroutine calls like this:</P>
<PRE>
 [% sub( param, param, param = value, param = value ) %]</PRE>
<P>The docs helpfully go on to say that all named parameters are put into
a single hashref and passed as the <STRONG>last</STRONG> parameter. The Component
handler takes all of the unnamed parameters and puts them into the
'_unnamed_' key of the hashref, then passes the hashref as the
ordinary first argument.</P>
<P>Example:</P>
<PRE>
 [% OI.comp( 'mycomponent', value1, value2, param3 = value3 ) %]</PRE>
<PRE>
 sub handler {
  my $class = shift;
  my $p     = shift;
  print &quot; --&gt; Value of param3: $p-&gt;{param3}\n&quot;;
  print &quot; --&gt; Unnamed: &quot;, join &quot; &gt;&gt; &quot;, @{ $p-&gt;{_unnamed_} }, &quot;\n&quot;; 
  ...
 }</PRE>
<P>Results:</P>
<PRE>
 --&gt; Value of param3: value3
 --&gt; Unnamed: value1 &gt;&gt; value2</PRE>
<P>Yes, this is an incentive to use named parameters. :) (Or rather, a
disincentive to using placement parameters.)</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="how to create a component">HOW TO CREATE A COMPONENT</A></H1>
<P>Every component simply calls an action. So you could define an action:</P>
<PRE>
 googlesearch =&gt; {
    class  =&gt; 'OpenInteract::Handler::Google',
    method =&gt; 'search',
 }</PRE>
<P>And call a component:</P>
<PRE>
 [% OI.comp( 'googlesearch', search_param =&gt; customer.company_name ) %]</PRE>
<P>This would deposit the results of the method right into your HTML.</P>
