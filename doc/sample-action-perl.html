    <h1>Sample action.perl Configuration</h1>

<pre><font size="-1">
# This is a sample action.perl file. Its purpose is to define the
# actions that OpenInteract can take based on the URL requested or
# other means. The keys are commented below.


$action = {

# 'action-key' - This is the published tag for this particular action
# -- the tag specifies how the various pieces of OpenInteract will be
# able to execute the action. See OpenInteract documentation under
# 'Action Table'. Note that whatever your key is, it should *ALWAYS*
# be lower-cased.

#   'action-key' => {

# class - The class that will execute the action. Can be blank if it's
# a template-only action.

#     class   => '',

# method - The method in 'class' (above) that will execute the
# action. If not specified we use the method defined in your
# application's 'server.perl' file (normally 'handler').

#     method  => '',

# redir - Instead of specifying information for a particular action,
# you can tell OI to lookup the information from another action. For
# instance, if you wanted both the '/Person/' and '/People/' URLs to
# run the same action, you could define the information in 'person'
# and then put for '/People/' something like:
#
#   'people' => { redir => 'person' },

#     redir   => '',

# template - You can also specify just a template for an action. This,
# along with the template package (in 'package'), is how template-only 
# components are specified. (See the OI Component Guide for more info.)

#     template => '',
#     package  => '',

# security - Check security for this action or not (normally used only
# with components). Default is 'yes', so if you do not security 
# specify 'no'

#     security      => '',

# Box parameters: if you are specifying a box with this action, you 
# can also list the following, which should be intuitive:

#     weight => 5,
#     title  => '',

#   },
};
