 no longer used.

 now in HTML in the main docs

1.36  Sat Dec  1 12:55:16 EST 2001

  information.

  (create/update/delete) has transpired on all objects that choose to
  participate

  - Replace 'static_page' package with 'base_page' package, with lots
  of improvements

  - Modified the Apache startup procedure to be cleaner


1.30 Mon Oct 15 01:35:03 EDT 2001

  - New OpenInteract::CommonHandler makes common
  search/display/edit/remove operations extremely simple.

  - New template widgets allow higher level form/page building, and to
  centralize display elements for site-wide consistency.

  - New package ('lookup') allows lookup table editing without any
  code

  - Speed up template through properly implemented TT caching and
  compiling

  - Bugfix release: base_security package that shipped with OI 1.2
  doesn't save the security settings properly.


1.2  Tue Aug 28 17:20:44 EDT 2001

  - Requires SPOPS version 0.50 and Class::Date

  - OpenInteract now supports LDAP for object storage as well as
  authentication.

  - Tighter Template Toolkit support requires translating old
  templates to new templates.

  - Multiple datastore handles for both LDAP and DBI available.

  - See UPGRADE for extensive changes to configuration file and
  specifics about template translation.

  - Lots of smaller changes -- see 'Changes' file for more info


1.1  Fri Jul 20 07:00:55 EDT 2001

  - Requires SPOPS version 0.41

  - New package 'results_manage' makes it simple to manage and persist
  search results

  - Many packages use the new SPOPS iterators to return results, which
  should reduce resource consumption, in some cases dramatically.

  - Many modules were moved from the 'base' package to the core
  distribution, which will hopefully make the whole process more
  understandable -- and browseable via 'perldoc'.

  - Lots of smaller changes -- see 'Changes' file for more info


1.07  Sun Jun 10 14:31:36 EDT 2001

  * Requires SPOPS version 0.40.

  * OpenInteract now works with Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise,
    Sybase Adaptive Server Anywhere, and PostgreSQL. It also works on
    Win32 systems using ActivePerl, Apache and the mod_perl binaries
    built by the excellent Randy Kobes.

  * Added additional optional DBI attributes to database configuration
    in conf/server.perl.

  * You'll need to make changes to the 'sys_security' table -- alter
    'oid' to be 'object_id' and 'level' to be 'security_level'.

  * You'll need to make changes to the 'object_track' table -- alter
    'oid' to be 'object_id'

  * Add the line:

    config_type  perl

    To your $WEBSITE/conf/base_config.conf file. The system will still
    work for now without this change, but it's a backwards
    compatibility shunt that won't always be there.

  * Add the following keys to your 'conf/server.perl' configuration
    file:

     {db_info}->{long_read_len} = 65536
     {db_info}->{long_trunc_ok} = 0

  * Change the following key:

     {system_alias}->{'OpenInteract::Cookies'}

    to:

     {system_alias}->{'OpenInteract::Cookies::Apache'}

    unless you're running on Win32, in which case change it to:

     {system_alias}->{'OpenInteract::Cookies::CGI'}
   
  * Lots of small changes -- see 'Changes' file for more info.


1.06  Sun Feb 25 15:16:43 EST 2001

  * Package repository format changed. See 'UPGRADE' for upgrading
    information.

  * Added new keys to server.conf:

     {session_info}->{expiration} = '+3M',

       (allows you to set a default expiration time for the session
        cookie)

     {system_alias}->{'OpenInteract::PackageRepository'} = 'repository',

       (alias used to reference the repository class)

     {box}->{custom_box_handler} = '',

       (allows you to define a handler to be called on every request
        to create/inspect/modify boxes)

   * Require new version of SPOPS (0.39); this forces you to set the
     spops.conf configuration key 'increment_field' to a true value if
     you want to use AUTO_INCREMENT fields for MySQL.
