INSTALLING OPENINTERACT
=========================

(NOTE: If you're upgrading from version 1.05 or earlier, please read
the file 'UPGRADE' in this directory.)


(1) Run the normal perl install

 perl Makefile.PL
 make
 make test (no tests yet...)
 make install

This procedure will install the base libraries. Normal Perl
installation rules apply.


(2) Run the OpenInteract install

Without changing directories from the directory where you unpacked the
OpenInteract distribution, run:

 oi_manage --base_dir=/path/to/installation install

The 'oi_manage' script should have been installed to a publically
accessible place (e.g., '/usr/local/bin' or '/usr/bin') for you when
you installed the rest of the library with 'make install'. If not,
just copy the file 'script/oi_manage' to an accessible place. (You can
also just run 'script/oi_manage install', but then 'oi_manage' won't
be accessible to manipulate future websites and configuration
information. This makes life hard for you. Why do that?)

This command creates the OpenInteract base directory and installs all
the packages that were distributed with the system.

That's it! OpenInteract is now installed and you should never need to
do this again. Upgrades to packages and installation of new packages
are done through the OpenInteract package system (and the 'oi_manage'
script) and work on existing installations.


(3) Read up

Check out the documentation: 

1. INSTALL.website (in this directory): Tells you how to create a new
OpenInteract website. This document is also copied to the website
directory when you create it.

2. doc/admin.html: More information about administering OpenInteract,
including notes about packages, creating websites, and
building/configuring Apache.
