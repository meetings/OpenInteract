=head1 NAME

OpenInteract2::Manual::Conversion - Moving your site and custom packages from OI 1.x to 2.x

=head1 SYNOPSIS 

This part of the manual will describe how to migrate your website and
packages from OpenInteract 1.x to OpenInteract 2.x.

=head1 BASE REPOSITORY

There is no more base repository! (The crowd cheers.) Every website
stands on its own, every package's classes sit in the
'OpenInteract2::' namespace. This makes for much simpler development
and deployment.

=head1 WEBSITE

All this should require is translating your server configuration and
any database schema changes.

=head2 Server Configuration

First off, OI 2.x exclusively uses the INI file format for the server
configuration. OI 1.x allowed you to use either the serialized Perl
data structure or the INI format. Hopefully you will see this as a
good thing.

There are no automatic conversion utilities for your server
configuration. The best thing to do is open both configuration files
in parallel editing windows and compare, copying relevant information
from your old file into the new one. ('C-x 3' in emacs is good for
this sort of thing...)

The basic structure of the configuration files is the same. New
information has been added -- datasources are unified, some names have
changed, etc. -- but generally you'll find information in the same
general location.

(TODO: Create a utility to pull information out of an existing INI
format and update the default one with it? Not all of the information,
just the highlights...)

=head2 Database

Instead of converting schemas from OI 1.x, it's recommended you
install OI 2.x to a separate database and use standard SQL tools to
migrate the data. Hopefully every package will have a document
C<DATA_CONVERSION> that will help with this process.

=head1 PACKAGES

Upgrading packages is undoubtedly the most resource intensive part of
the upgrade. It will definitely require some work, but your work will
be justly rewarded. And there are a few utilities packaged with OI2 to
do at least some of the grunt work for you.

We'll break the process into pieces roughly mirroring the package
directory structure.

=head2 Package Metadata (.)

This consists of the files:

=over 4

=item *

package.conf

=item *

Changes

=item *

MANIFEST

=item *

MANIFEST.SKIP

=back

There is no structural change necessary for these files to
work. However, depending on your scenario you may wish to upgrade your
package by a whole version number to indicate that it will only work
with OI2. This also allows you to maintain two source trees for a
particular package, just in case you need to support both of them.

B<package.conf>

The only structural change is that the 'template_blocks' directive has
been removed from the package configuration.

To change:

=over 4

=item *

B<sql_installer>: Update the class name from
'OpenInteract::SQLInstaller::Foo' to
'OpenInteract2::SQLInstaller::Poo'.

=back

B<MANIFEST>

There will be a few file name changes throughout the process. But
rather than list them all here, just remember that any
renamings/removals will have to be reflected here. Running:

 oi2_manage check_package

from your package's root directory will still let you know of any
discrepancies between your C<MANIFEST> and the files in the directory.

You can also use the L<ExtUtils::Manifest|ExtUtils::Manifest> trick:

  $ perl -MExtUtils::Manifest -e 'ExtUtils::Manifest::mkmanifest()'


=head2 Configuration (conf/)

OpenInteract2 has abandoned the Perl data structure as configuration
file. It's too difficult to edit and when generated isn't formatted
for humans to read. Instead we're using the INI file format for both
the action configuration and the SPOPS configurations.

Two scripts are included with OI2 to help with this task:

=over 4

=item *

C<script/translate_action_to_ini.pl>

=item *

C<script/translate_spops_to_ini.pl>

=back

Both are just wrappers around a class found under
C<OpenInteract2::Conversion>. They work on STDIN and STDOUT:

  $ cd /path/to/OpenInteract-2.00-source/script
  $ perl translate_action_to_ini.pl < ~/pkg/mypkg/conf/action.perl > action.ini
  $ perl translate_spops_to_ini.pl < ~/pkg/mypkg/conf/spops.perl > spops.ini
  


In addition to doing the fairly simple conversion from the Perl data
structure to INI, it also does a few modifications to your data. Some
of these are key renamings (e.g., the 'security' key in your action
configuration should now be 'is_secure') while others remove now
unnecessary data (e.g., most items in your 'isa' are now unnecessary,
as OI2 creates it properly at startup).

After running the script you should still check the configuration to
ensure everything worked and make any additional modifications. In
particular, the keys of the 'links_to' and 'has_a' configuration items
are not yet modified from C<OpenInteract::Foo> to
C<OpenInteract2::Foo>.

Finally, in the packages shipped with OpenInteract2 we've kept all the
action configuration entries in a single file (C<action.ini>) but
moved the configuration for each SPOPS object into its own file (e.g.,
C<spops_news.ini>, C<spops_news_section.ini>). You can keep all your
SPOPS configurations in a single file, but they're probably easier to
edit if they're in multiple files.

B<NOTE>: Each SPOPS configuration file should begin with C<spops> so
the OI2 startup procedure can find it. You may also list your SPOPS
configuration files in your C<package.conf> file under the key
C<spops_file>.

=head2 Documentation (doc/)

Documentation is pretty much the same. The system documentation tool
under C</SystemDoc/> will pick up all POD files in a package's C<doc/>
directory. Instead of using an index (C<titles>) that always, always
got out of sync, we instead just parse all the docs and grab the title
out of it. Yes, it's more expensive, but how often are you browsing
package docs? (And you have fast disk drives and/or an aggressively
caching filesystem, right?)

And because OI no longer has error handlers you can delete the
C<ERRORS> section from your POD. (Packages generated with OI had this
by default.)

To change:

=over 4

=item *

C<titles> - Delete this file, it's no longer used.

=item *

C<package.pod> - If you have a file of this name, rename it to
'packagename'.pod -- e.g., 'gallery.pod' if you're modifying the
'gallery' package, etc.

=back

=head2 Package data (data/)

While the data installation process has been completely rewritten (see
L<OpenInteract2::SQLInstall|OpenInteract2::SQLInstall>, the data
declarations have only small changes. Two of the conversion
declarations were removed since they're no longer necessary with the
elimination of the base repository:

=over 4

=item *

C<transform_class_to_website>

=item *

C<transform_class_to_oi>

=back

And the remaining two conversion declarations were renamed:

=over 4

=item *

Old value: C<transform_default_to_id>

New value: C<transform_default>

=item *

Old value: C<transform_to_now>

New value: C<transform_now>

=back

=head2 SQL Structures (struct/)

These should remain the same.

=head2 Template (template/)

=head2 Libraries (OpenInteract/)

=head2 Handlers (OpenInteract/Handler)

=head2 Examples (eg/)

No changes.

=head2 HTML files/images (html/)

No changes.

=head2 Standalone scripts (script/)

No changes, besides needing to rewrite them to use the new OI2
features.
