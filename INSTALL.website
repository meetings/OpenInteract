INSTALLING AN OPENINTERACT WEBSITE
========================================

This document should help you install an OpenInteract website. (Think
of OpenInteract as two parts: the installation and any number of
websites. Without a website, the installation is pretty useless, and a
website cannot exist without the installation.)


(1) Install a website

Be sure OpenInteract is installed and note its directory. This is
referred to as the 'base_dir' below.

Assuming that the directory you specified for the scripts packaged
with OpenInteract is in your path, you can then install a new
website:

 $ oi_manage --base_dir=%%INTERACT_DIR%% \
             --website_name=%%WEBSITE_NAME%% \
             --website_dir=%%WEBSITE_DIR%% \
             create_website

This creates a new website in the 'website_dir' you specified
and installs all the packages necessary to run OpenInteract. (If the
'website_dir' directory already exists the command will fail.)


(2) Configure the website.

When you install a website, you also get a few configuration
files. Most of the values in the files have been filled in for you,
but some have not.

With a plaintext editor (emacs, vi, pico, etc.) Edit the file:

 %%WEBSITE_DIR%%/conf/server.ini

Change the following values:

 [mail]
 smtp_host = 127.0.0.1

   Set to an available server to use for an SMTP host. If you don't
   know, check whether localhost (127.0.0.1) works.


 [mail]
 admin_email = admin@mycompany.com

   Set to your email address. You can change this later if you want.


 [db_info]

   This tells OpenInteract how to connect to your database. Here are
   some sample values:

      [db_info main]
      db_owner      =
      username      = dbuser
      password      = dbpassword
      dsn           = mysql
      db_name       = MyAppDB
      driver_name   = mysql
      sql_install   =
      long_read_len = 65536
      long_trunc_ok = 0

   Note that you can configure multiple datasources -- 'main' is the
   default and is used when you don't specify a 'dataource'
   configuration value in your SPOPS object. To specify another one,
   just copy-and-paste the above, then change:

     [db_info main]

   to:

     [db_info newdatasource]

 [ldap_info]

   Skip this step if you're not using LDAP.

   This tells OpenInteract how to connect to your LDAP
   directories. Here are some sample values:

      [ldap_info main]
      host          = localhost
      port          = 389
      bind_dn       =
      bind_password =
      base_dn       = dc=mycompany,dc=com
      timeout       = 120
      version       = 2
      sasl          = 0
      debug         = 0

   Note that you can configure multiple datasources -- 'main' is the
   default and is used when you don't specify a 'dataource'
   configuration value in your SPOPS object. (See example above under
   'db_info' for creating a new one.)

 [session_info]

   If you're using MySQL as your SQL database, you can leave this
   alone. Otherwise you'll probably want to change it to whatever is
   relevant for you (e.g., 'Apache::Session::Postgres',
   'Apache::Session::File', ...)

That's it!

(Note that you might want to be careful with permissions used on this
file since it has sensitive username/password information.)

There are, of course, many other modifications you can make to the
server configuration, but these changes should get you up and running.

(3) Create your database and test the connection

If the database for which you entered information in the previous step
isn't created, do so now. (The specific action for doing this depends
on the database you're using. You might need to talk to an
administrator to perform the action.)

Once the database is created, you can test the database connection
from OpenInteract's point of view:

 $ oi_manage --website_dir=%%WEBSITE_DIR%% test_db

If everything comes back marked 'ok', then you're in good shape.

Similarly, if you're also using LDAP you can run:

 $ oi_manage --website_dir=%%WEBSITE_DIR%% test_ldap


(4) Change SPOPS classes (optional)

OpenInteract comes configured to work with the MySQL DBMS. If you're
not using MySQL, you need to tell OpenInteract to use a different
SPOPS database driver. Otherwise you'll get lots of messages like:

  =========================
  static_page (1.31)
    OK:

      Structure:
        * Created table from (basic_page.sql): ok
      Data:
        * install_data for Pg: no action taken
      Security:
        * Error: Cannot create SPOPS object!
      Basic: Record saved, but ID of record unknown at
      .../SPOPS/SPOPS/Key/DBI/HandleField.pm line 39.

      Error: Cannot retrieve just-inserted ID from table
      using field (mysql_insertid)


Below is a mapping of databases to parameters. Use the appropriate
parameter when running the following command:

 $ oi_manage --website_dir=%%WEBSITE_DIR%% \
             --driver=? change_spops_driver

Database        Command
==============  ===========================
PostgreSQL      --driver=SPOPS::DBI::Pg
Sybase ASA/ASE  --driver=SPOPS::DBI::Sybase
MS SQL Server   --driver=SPOPS::DBI::Sybase
MySQL           --driver=SPOPS::DBI::MySQL

(MySQL given just in case you need to change it back!)


(5) Install SQL files and data

If you'd like, go into the 'pkg/' directory and explore the files in
each package's 'data/' and 'struct' directories. These will be
executed in the next step, but if you'd like to change information go
ahead. 

Run the command:

 $ oi_manage --website_dir=%%WEBSITE_DIR%% \
             --package=INITIAL \
             install_sql

(Note: capitalization of 'INITIAL' is important!)

This installs the SQL structures and initial data for the packages
shipped with OpenInteract. Hopefully all the statements and programs
execute with an 'ok' status.

Be sure to view the status messages! Some packages might install
default information and give you details about that information in
these messages. 

For instance, the 'base_user' package creates a 'superuser' user
object and assigns it a random eight-character password. This password
is displayed in the status messages, and if you chose 'crypt_password'
in your configuration file you will NEVER be able to know the password
for the superuser. If this happens, you can just drop the database,
recreate it and re-run the 'install_sql' command.


(6) Import templates (optional)

OpenInteract will work fine if you do not run this step.

You can now bring the templates used in the various packages into your
database. Once this is done you can edit them via the web browser.

OpenInteract will work with the templates in the filesystem, but you
won't be able to edit them via the browser. Additionally, some
databases may provide a speed improvement with templates in the
database. It's up to you.

To import them, run the command:

 $ oi_manage --website_dir=%%WEBSITE_DIR%% \ 
             --package=INITIAL \
             install_template

This installs the templates from the packages listed into you SQL
database. Note that you can make changes to the templates at any time
and re-import them into the database using this same command.


(7) Edit Apache virtual host configuration

Using the static/modperl configuration assumes that you have already
setup a front-end proxy configuration as discussed at the following
URLs:

 http://perl.apache.org/guide/strategy.html#Alternative_architectures_for_ru
 http://perl.apache.org/guide/scenario.html#One_Light_and_One_Heavy_Server_w
 http://perl.apache.org/guide/scenario.html#mod_proxy

Further, OpenInteract assumes that if you're running the proxy server
configuration you've setup the front-end to pass the IP address to the
back-end, as described in:

 http://perl.apache.org/guide/scenario.html#Getting_the_Remote_Server_IP_in_

The OpenInteract Administrator's Guide (found in doc/admin.html) has
details about building the different servers. It's definitely worth
the time to read about this setup because it can help OpenInteract be
a big success for you.

Edit the files:

 %%WEBSITE_DIR%%/conf/httpd_static.conf
 %%WEBSITE_DIR%%/conf/httpd_modperl.conf

And follow the directions there.

If you want to run OpenInteract without a proxy server in front, just
edit the file:

 %%WEBSITE_DIR%%/conf/httpd_modperl_solo.conf

And only bring that in (see next step).

If you're not using virtual hosts, then copy the information within
the <VirtualHost></VirtualHost> tags into your main config file and
skip the next step.


(8) Edit Apache configuration

If you're using the proxy server setup:

  In your static httpd server configuration, add the line:

    Include %%WEBSITE_DIR%%/conf/httpd_static.conf

  and in your mod_perl httpd server configuration, add the line:

    Include %%WEBSITE_DIR%%/conf/httpd_modperl.conf

If you're using the solo mod_perl setup:

    Include %%WEBSITE_DIR%%/conf/httpd_modperl_solo.conf

(9) Run Apache!

Startup Apache as you normally would, and hopefully everything will
be up and running!


(10) Connect to your website

Open up a web browser to your hostname or IP address. You should see a
welcome page. Login with the username 'superuser' and the password you
saw in step (4). 

Create a new user for yourself (click on the 'Users - new' link in the
Admin Tools box), and then assign the user to the 'site admin' group
(click on 'Groups - list' in the Admin Tools box and then the name of
the 'site admin' group to pull up a form).

Now: have some fun!
