INSTALLING AN OPENINTERACT WEBSITE

This document should help you install an OpenInteract website. (Think
of OpenInteract as two parts: the installation and any number of
websites. Without a website, the installation is pretty useless, and a
website cannot exist without the installation.)


(1) Install a website

Be sure OpenInteract is installed and note its directory. This is
referred to as the 'base_dir' below.

Assuming that the directory you specified for the scripts packaged
with OpenInteract is in your path, you can then install a new
website:

 oi_manage --base_dir=%%INTERACT_DIR%% \
           --website_name=%%WEBSITE_NAME%% \
           --website_dir=%%WEBSITE_DIR%% \
           create_website

This creates a new website in the 'website_dir' you specified
and installs all the packages necessary to run OpenInteract. (If the
'website_dir' directory already exists the command will fail.)


(2) Configure the website.

When you install a website, you also get a few configuration
files. Most of the values in the files have been filled in for you,
but some have not.

With a plaintext editor (emacs, vi, pico, etc.) Edit the file:

 %%WEBSITE_DIR%%/conf/server.perl

Change the following values:

 'smtp_host' 

   Set to an available server to use for an SMTP host. If you don't
   know, check whether localhost (127.0.0.1) works.

 'admin_email'

   Set to your email address. You can change this later if you want.

 'session_info' 

   If you're using MySQL as your SQL database, you can leave this
   alone. Otherwise you'll probably want to change it to either
   'Apache::Session::Sybase' (if you're using a Sybase database) or
   'Apache::Session::DBI' for most other SQL databases.

 'db_info'

   This tells OpenInteract how to connect to your database. Here are
   some sample values:

       ...
       'db_info' => {
         'db_owner'    => '',
         'username'    => 'dbuser',
         'password'    => 'dbpassword',
         'dsn'         => 'mysql',
         'db_name'     => 'MyAppDB',
         'driver_name' => 'mysql',
       },
       ...

That's it!

(Note that you might want to be careful with permissions used on this
file since it has sensitive username/password information.)


(3) Create your database and test the connection

If the database for which you entered information in the previous step
isn't created, do so now. (The specific action for doing this depends
on the database you're using. You might need to talk to an
administrator to perform the action.)

Once the database is created, you can test the database connection
from OpenInteract's point of view:

 oi_manage --website_dir=%%WEBSITE_DIR%% test_db

If everything comes back marked 'ok', then you're in good shape.


(4) Install SQL files

If you'd like, go into the 'pkg/' directory and explore the files in
each package's 'data/' and 'struct' directories. These will be
executed in the next step, but if you'd like to change information go
ahead. 

Run the command:

 oi_manage --website_dir=%%WEBSITE_DIR%% \
           --package=INITIAL \
           install_sql

(Note: capitalization of 'INITIAL' is important!)

This installs the SQL structures and initial data for the packages
shipped with OpenInteract. Hopefully all the statements and programs
execute with an 'ok' status.

Be sure to view the status messages! Some packages might install
default information and give you details about that information in
these messages. For instance, the 'base_user' package creates a
'superuser' user object and assigns it a random eight-character
password. This password is displayed in the status messages, and if
you chose 'crypt_password' in your configuration file you will NEVER
be able to know the password for the superuser. If this happens,
you'll have to just remove the directory tree with your website and
reinstall. Yuck.


(5) Import templates

Bring the templates used in the various packages into your
database. Once this is done you can edit them via the web browser.

Run the command:

 oi_manage --website_dir=%%WEBSITE_DIR%% \ 
           --package=INITIAL \
           install_template

This installs the templates from the packages listed into you SQL
database. Note that you can make changes to the templates at any time
and re-import them into the database using this same command.


(6) Edit Apache virtual host configuration

Using the static/modperl configuration assumes that you have already
setup a front-end proxy configuration as discussed at the following
URLs:

 http://perl.apache.org/guide/strategy.html#Alternative_architectures_for_ru
 http://perl.apache.org/guide/scenario.html#One_Light_and_One_Heavy_Server_w
 http://perl.apache.org/guide/scenario.html#mod_proxy

Further, OpenInteract assumes that if you're running the proxy server
configuration you've setup the front-end to pass the IP address to the
back-end, as described in:

 http://perl.apache.org/guide/scenario.html#Getting_the_Remote_Server_IP_in_

The OpenInteract Administrator's Guide (found in doc/admin.html) has
details about building the different servers. It's definitely worth
the time to read about this setup because it can help OpenInteract be
a big success for you.

Edit the files:

 %%WEBSITE_DIR%%/conf/httpd_static.conf
 %%WEBSITE_DIR%%/conf/httpd_modperl.conf

And follow the directions there.

If you're not using virtual hosts, then copy the information within
the <VirtualHost></VirtualHost> tags into your main config file and
skip the next step.


(7) Edit Apache configuration

In your static httpd server configuration, add the line:

 Include %%WEBSITE_DIR%%/conf/httpd_static.conf

and in your mod_perl httpd server configuration, add the line:

 Include %%WEBSITE_DIR%%/conf/httpd_modperl.conf


(8) Run Apache!

Startup Apache as you normally would, and hopefully everything will
be up and running!


(9) Connect to your website

Open up a web browser to your hostname or IP address. You should see a
welcome page. Login with the username 'superuser' and the password you
saw in step (4). 

Create a new user for yourself (click on the 'Users - new' link in the
Admin Tools box), and then assign the user to the 'site admin' group
(click on 'Groups - list' in the Admin Tools box and then the 'Detail'
link next to the site admin group.)

Now you can start having fun!
