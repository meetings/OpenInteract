Revision history for Perl extension OpenInteract.

1.05  Thu Feb  1 00:26:14 EST 2001

  Added 'setup_static_environment' to OpenInteract/Startup.pm -- this
  makes it *incredibly* easy to setup an OI environment outside of
  Apache/CGI/Web-whatever, allowing you to do data reporting, import,
  export, etc. 

  Refactored (not 100%, but still pretty well) OpenInteract/Package.pm
  to be easier to understand, including breaking up longer 'meaty'
  subroutines into easier-to-digest versions. Added lots of POD
  documentation as well.

  Added website installation message to 'oi_manage' and modified it to
  display an 'INSTALL' file whenever the package is installed to a
  website (either via 'upgrade' or 'apply'). This means that package
  authors can alert users to potential schema change or other API
  modifications and be sure that users will see this when the package
  is applied/upgraded -- minimize potential user excuses :-)

  The basic OpenInteract documentation (included with the Perl
  distributed in 'doc/') is now copied over to the OpenInteract base
  installation directory (when you do 'oi_manage install') and is
  copied from there to a website's HTML directory when you create a
  new one. This means that the HTML OI documentation is available when
  you first fire up your browser to see your website.

  Lots of modifications to many packages, including the addition of a
  new package to the core OpenInteract family: base_box. Let's give
  him a big hand!

1.04  Thu Dec 21 01:01:14 EST 2000

  Modified OpenInteract/Package.pm to accommodate earlier versions of
  Archive::Tar, which had very different interfaces. Added some more
  items to the PREREQ piece of Makefile.PL and scrapped the
  'INSTALLSCRIPT' option to let MakeMaker put the bin files in the
  "right" place. 

  **NOTE -- this means you should remove all older versions of
  'oi_manage' that might be someplace like '/usr/local/bin'**

  We now require version 2.00 of the Template Toolkit. Version 1.06+
  might still work, but it's no longer actively supported.

  Modified scripts/oi_manage to implement a 'list_actions' command,
  which reads in all your website action.perl files and then tells you
  all the actions programmed in the system and which package the
  action comes from.

  Many changes to various packages -- see the changelogs for
  'base', 'base_security', 'base_theme', 'static_page' and several
  others.

1.03  Nov 30 2000

  Added some modifications to when you install OpenInteract and when
  you create a new package (OpenInteract/Package.pm;
  script/oi_manage). Modified documentation in the Developer and Admin
  guides as well as the two INSTALL documents; got that bulky .GIF out
  of the distribution, replacing it with a slightly lame Visio
  drawing (to PNG).

  Relatively minor fixes to the packages news, base_error, base and
  system_doc. See their 'Changes' files for more info.

  Modified scripts/oi_manage to have the same semantics for
  'check_package' as for 'export_package' -- that is, you can chdir to
  the working directory for a package and run the command without any
  parameters and have a check properly performed.

  (minor) Superficial change in just about every file to modify email
  'cwinters@intes.net' to 'chris@cwinters.com'. Also changed all RCS
  '$Header' tags to '$Id'.

1.02  Nov 10 2000

  Package management and oi_manage routines are pretty much rock-solid
  as done from informal testing. We've made new installs and websites
  by the handful and everything has gone well. Added lots of overall
  documentation (in the 'doc/' directory) including targeted guides
  for managers, administrators and developers, plus a glossary, all in
  HTML format. Eliminated a pretty evil bug in the
  'OpenInteract/Template.pm' file of the 'base' package which only
  manifested itself when running more than one website. SQL
  installation has also been smoothed out and tested in numerous
  ways. Lots of other little changes (structure, format, etc.).

  Also made some changes to terminology and enforced it throughout. A
  'base installation' is where you first install OpenInteract (using
  'oi_manage') and a 'server' is the Apache/mod_perl process. A
  'website' is a particular instantiation of OpenInteract with its own
  packages, namespace, etc. The definition for 'package' hasn't really
  changed, but we've made a package kindasorta synonymous with 'tool',
  even though a package can contain more than one tool. 

1.01  Nov 3 2000

  Lots of new things -- massively overhauled package management
  (oi_manage and OpenInteract::Package) including scads of
  documentation and the functions for package removal and upgrade
  capabilities, you can check a package, get a listing of packages
  installed to an application or to the base installation, and can now
  create a 'skeleton' package, which should help out a little bit with
  development; more documentation in the packages distributed with the
  system. You can also add or dump a package's templates, test a
  database connection given the configuration parameters for an
  application, and (more below) install the SQL structures and data
  for a package.

  Added the class 'OpenInteract::DBI' which gives us a central
  location for connecting to a database. Also modified how the
  configuration file is setup wrt database info.

  All 'module.perl' files will hereafter be known as 'action.perl' --
  this is so we can better communicate the concept of the 'Action
  Table' and what it means when you're developing packages and
  applications.

  Added lots of configuration documentation -- see all the files in
  'conf/'. The 'spops.perl' and 'action.perl' files are now
  well-documented and OpenInteract::Package was modified to copy these
  sample files into a new package when a skeleton is created.

  Also modified the 'full_text' scripts for doing certain actions from
  the command-line -- these are good scripts to review if you want to
  create an OpenInteract 'environment' (all the classes created and
  linked, database handle and config object created, etc.) from a
  script rather than from mod_perl.

  Added 'OpenInteract::SQLInstall' and modified all of the packages to
  use its methods as well as translated their incoming structures and
  data to its format. (This was much more work than it sounds like :)

  Numerous other small-to-medium fixes here and there.
