# This is a sample action.ini file. Its purpose is to define the
# actions that OpenInteract2 can take based on the URL requested or
# other means. The keys are commented below. (You can of course change
# anything you like. I've only used your package name as a base from
# which to start.)

# 'foo' - Published name for this action; this is how
# other parts of OI2 find the action. (Will always be lower-case.)

[foo]

# class - The class that will execute the action. Can be blank if it's
# a template-only action.

class   = OpenInteract2::Action::Foo

# Other keys you might want to investigate - 
# see OpenInteract2::Action for more:
#
# task_default: task to assign when none specified in the URL
# is_secure:    whether Check security for this action or not (default: 'no')
# method:       instead of calling arbitrary routines you can direct all requests to one
# action_type:  base for action; OI2 comes with 'template_only' and 'lookup'
